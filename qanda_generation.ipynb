Born and raised in Houston, Texas, she performed in various singing and dancing competitions as a child, and rose to fame in the late 1990s as lead singer of R&B girl-group Destiny's Child. Managed by her father, Mathew Knowles, the group became one of the world's best-selling girl groups of all time. Their hiatus saw the release of Beyonc\\u00e9's debut album, Dangerously in Love (2003), which established her as a solo artist worldwide, earned five Grammy Awards and featured the Billboard Hot 100

Analysis of the relationship is further complicated by modern political conflicts and the application of Westphalian sovereignty to a time when the concept did not exist. Some Mainland Chinese scholars, such as Wang Jiawei and Nyima Gyaincain, assert that the Ming dynasty had unquestioned sovereignty over Tibet, pointing to the Ming court's issuing of various titles to Tibetan leaders, Tibetans' full acceptance of these titles, and a renewal process for successors of these titles that involved traveling to the Ming capital. Scholars within China also argue that Tibet has been an integral part of China since the 13th century and that it was thus a part of the Ming Empire. But most scholars outside China, such as Turrell V. Wylie, Melvin C. Goldstein, and Helmut Hoffman, say that the relationship was one of suzerainty, that Ming titles were only nominal, that Tibet remained an independent region outside Ming control, and that it simply paid tribute until the Jiajing Emperor (1521\\u20131566), who ceased relations with Tibet.\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56cc239e6d243a140015eeb7\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"who\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Mainland Chinese scholars\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 274\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"The iPod is a line of portable media players and multi-purpose pocket computers designed and marketed by Apple Inc.

It is the thirteenth installment in the The Legend of Zelda series. Originally planned for release on the GameCube in November 2005, Twilight Princess was delayed by Nintendo to allow its developers to refine the game, add more content, and port it to the Wii. The Wii version was released alongside the console in North America in November 2006, and in Japan, Europe, and Australia the following month.

However, G\\u00f6del could not have come to this conclusion without Whitehead and Russell's book. In this way, Principia Mathematica's legacy might be described as its key role in disproving the possibility of achieving its own stated goals.

Proper lighting can enhance task performance, improve the appearance of an area, or have positive psychological effects on occupants.\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56de0fef4396321400ee2583\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Daylighting\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 245\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56de0fef4396321400ee2584\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"positive\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 597\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56de0fef4396321400ee2585\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"energy consumption\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 475\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56de0fef4396321400ee2586\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"artificial light sources\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 134\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56de0fef4396321400ee2587\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"The use of light to achieve an aesthetic effect is know as?\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Lighting or illumination\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 0\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56de1377cffd8e1900b4b5b2\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Daylighting\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 245\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56de1377cffd8e1900b4b5b3\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Lighting\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 0\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56de1377cffd8e1900b4b5b4\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"positive\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 597\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56de1377cffd8e1900b4b5b5\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"energy consumption\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 475\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56de1377cffd8e1900b4b5b6\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Lighting or illumination\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 0\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"Separation of powers is a political doctrine originating in the writings of Montesquieu in The Spirit of the Laws where he urged for a constitutional government with three separate branches of government.

This philosophy heavily influenced the writing of the United States Constitution, according to which the Legislative, Executive, and Judicial branches of the United States government are kept distinct in order to prevent abuse of power.

It had its origins in the missile-based nuclear arms race between the two nations that occurred following World War II, enabled by captured German rocket technology and personnel. The technological superiority required for such supremacy was seen as necessary for national security, and symbolic of ideological superiority. The Space Race spawned pioneering efforts to launch artificial satellites, unmanned space probes of the Moon, Venus, and Mars, and human spaceflight in low Earth orbit and to the Moon. The competition began on August 2, 1955, when the Soviet Union responded to the US announcement four days earlier of intent to launch artificial satellites for the International Geophysical Year, by declaring they would also launch a satellite \\\"in the near future\\\". The Soviet Union beat the US to this, with the October 4, 1957 orbiting of Sputnik 1, and later beat the US to the first human in space, Yuri Gagarin, on April 12, 1961. The Space Race peaked with the July 20, 1969 US landing of the first humans on the Moon with Apollo 11. The USSR tried but failed manned lunar missions, and eventually cancelled them and concentrated on Earth orbital space stations.

In all three traditions, a canon was originally a rule adopted by a church council; these canons formed the foundation of canon law.\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56e0f09d231d4119001ac476\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Canon law\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 0\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56e0f09d231d4119001ac477\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Christian\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 124\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56e0f09d231d4119001ac478\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"which\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Latin Church and Eastern Catholic Churches\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 248\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56e0f09d231d4119001ac479\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"church council\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 606\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56e0f09d231d4119001ac47a\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"canons\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 628\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"Communications in Somalia encompasses the communications services and capacity of Somalia.

Additionally, the national postal service is slated to be officially relaunched in 2013 after a long absence.

The building itself is the original abbey church.\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56e6dcc16fe0821900b8ebfc\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Collegiate Church of St Peter at Westminster\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 39\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56e6dcc16fe0821900b8ebfd\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Gothic\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 104\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56e6dcc16fe0821900b8ebfe\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"City of Westminster, London\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 131\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56e6dcc16fe0821900b8ebff\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Between 1540 and 1556\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 394\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56e6dcc16fe0821900b8ec00\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Royal Peculiar\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 580\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56e8ceee99e8941900975ea5\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"the Collegiate Church of St Peter at Westminster\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 35\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56e8ceee99e8941900975ea6\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"where\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"City of Westminster, London\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 131\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56e8ceee99e8941900975ea8\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"when\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Between 1540 and 1556\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 394\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56e8ceee99e8941900975ea9\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Church of England \\\"Royal Peculiar\\\"\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 561\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"Nanjing ( listen; Chinese: \\u5357\\u4eac, \\\"Southern Capital\\\") is the city situated in the heartland of lower Yangtze River region in China, which has long been a major centre of culture, education, research, politics, economy, transport networks and tourism. It is the capital city of Jiangsu province of People's Republic of China and the second largest city in East China, with a total population of 8,216,100, and legally the capital of Republic of China which lost the mainland during the civil war. The city whose name means \\\"Southern Capital\\\" has a prominent place in Chinese history and culture, having served as the capitals of various Chinese dynasties, kingdoms and republican governments dating from the 3rd century AD to 1949. Prior to the advent of pinyin romanization, Nanjing's city name was spelled as Nanking or Nankin. Nanjing has a number of other names, and some historical names are now used as names of districts of the city, and among them there is the name Jiangning (\\u6c5f\\u5be7), whose former character Jiang (\\u6c5f, River) is the former part of the name Jiangsu and latter character Ning (\\u5be7, simplified form \\u5b81, Peace) is the short name of Nanjing. When being the capital of a state, for instance, ROC, Jing (\\u4eac) is adopted as the abbreviation of Nanjing. Although as a city located in southern part of China becoming Chinese national capital as early as in Jin dynasty, the name Nanjing was designated to the city in Ming dynasty, about a thousand years later.

The major time divisions of classical music are as follows: the early music period, which includes the Medieval (500\\u20131400) and the Renaissance (1400\\u20131600) eras; the Common practice period, which includes the Baroque (1600\\u20131750), Classical (1750\\u20131820), and Romantic eras (1804\\u20131910); and the 20th century (1901\\u20132000) which includes the modern (1890\\u20131930) that overlaps from the late 19th-century, the high modern (mid 20th-century), and contemporary or postmodern (1975\\u20132015) eras.[citation needed]\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56f6e729711bf01900a44858\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"the Classical period\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 217\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56f6e729711bf01900a44859\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"1400\\u20131600\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 663\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56f6e729711bf01900a4485a\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"1600\\u20131750\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 736\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56f6e729711bf01900a4485b\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Romantic\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 775\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56f6e729711bf01900a4485c\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Western music\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 69\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56f6ed94711bf01900a44874\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Western\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 69\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56f6ed94711bf01900a44875\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"the Classical period\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 217\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56f6ed94711bf01900a44876\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"between 1550 and 1900\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 450\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56f6ed94711bf01900a44877\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"when\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"1400\\u20131600\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 663\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56f6ed94711bf01900a44878\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"when\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"1890\\u20131930\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 862\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"Slavs are the largest Indo-European ethno-linguistic group in Europe.

During World War II he was the leader of the Partisans, often regarded as the most effective resistance movement in occupied Europe. While his presidency has been criticized as authoritarian, and concerns about the repression of political opponents have been raised, Tito was \\\"seen by most as a benevolent dictator\\\" due to his economic and diplomatic policies. He was a popular public figure both in Yugoslavia and abroad. Viewed as a unifying symbol, his internal policies maintained the peaceful coexistence of the nations of the Yugoslav federation. He gained further international attention as the chief leader of the Non-Aligned Movement, working with Jawaharlal Nehru of India, Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt and Sukarno of Indonesia.\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56f71177711bf01900a4490a\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"1980\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 221\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56f71177711bf01900a4490b\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"the Partisans,\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 268\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56f71177711bf01900a4490c\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Yugoslavia\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 627\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56f71177711bf01900a4490d\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"which\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Gamal Abdel Nasser\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 911\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56f71177711bf01900a4490e\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"which\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Sukarno\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 943\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"The Marshall Islands, officially the Republic of the Marshall Islands (Marshallese: Aolep\\u0101n Aor\\u014dkin M\\u0327aje\\u013c),[note 1] is an island country located near the equator in the Pacific Ocean, slightly west of the International Date Line.

The Caucasus Mountains are higher, and the Urals longer, but both lie partly in Asia. The mountains were formed over tens of millions of years as the African and Eurasian tectonic plates collided. Extreme shortening caused by the event resulted in marine sedimentary rocks rising by thrusting and folding into high mountain peaks such as Mont Blanc and the Matterhorn. Mont Blanc spans the French\\u2013Italian border, and at 4,810 m (15,781 ft) is the highest mountain in the Alps.

The Allen brothers decided to name the city after Sam Houston, the popular general at the Battle of San Jacinto, who was elected President of Texas in September 1836. The great majority of slaves in Texas came with their owners from the older slave states. Sizable numbers, however, came through the domestic slave trade. New Orleans was the center of this trade in the Deep South, but there were slave dealers in Houston. Thousands of enslaved African-Americans lived near the city before the Civil War. Many of them near the city worked on sugar and cotton plantations, while most of those in the city limits had domestic and artisan jobs. In 1860 forty-nine percent of the city's population was enslaved. A few slaves, perhaps as many as 2,000 between 1835 and 1865, came through the illegal African trade. Post-war Texas grew rapidly as migrants poured into the cotton lands of the state. They also brought or purchased enslaved African Americans, whose numbers nearly tripled in the state from 1850 to 1860, from 58,000 to 182,566.\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57093943efce8f15003a7dba\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"where\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"New York\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 95\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57093943efce8f15003a7dbb\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"how\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"6,642\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 115\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57093943efce8f15003a7dbc\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"founding a city\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 186\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57093943efce8f15003a7dbd\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"who\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Sam Houston\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 253\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57093943efce8f15003a7dbe\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"1836\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 364\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5709aeceed30961900e84408\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"who\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Allen brothers\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 207\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5709aeceed30961900e84409\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"how\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"6,642 acres\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 115\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5709aeceed30961900e8440a\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"which\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Sam Houston\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 253\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5709aeceed30961900e8440b\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"forty-nine percent\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 853\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5709aeceed30961900e8440c\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"how\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"tripled\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 1176\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"In the Roman era, copper was principally mined on Cyprus, the origin of the name of the metal from aes \\u0441yprium (metal of Cyprus), later corrupted to \\u0441uprum, from which the words copper (English), cuivre (French), Koper (Dutch) and Kupfer (German) are all derived.

Speech also contains nonverbal elements known as paralanguage, e.g. rhythm, intonation, tempo, and stress. There may even be a pheromone component. Research has shown that up to 55% of human communication may occur through non-verbal facial expressions, and a further 38% through paralanguage. It affects communication most at the subconscious level and establishes trust. Likewise, written texts include nonverbal elements such as handwriting style, spatial arrangement of words and the use of emoticons to convey emotion.\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57096026ed30961900e84018\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"conveying meaning in the form of non-word messages\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 49\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57096026ed30961900e84019\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"body language\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 202\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57096026ed30961900e8401a\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"shaking a hand\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 392\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57096026ed30961900e8401b\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"sweating\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 451\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57096026ed30961900e8401c\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"55%\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 639\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"Grapes are a type of fruit that grow in clusters of 15 to 300, and can be crimson, black, dark blue, yellow, green, orange, and pink. \\\"White\\\" grapes are actually green in color, and are evolutionarily derived from the purple grape.

However, the UK government relaxed legislation in 1963, followed by Australia in 1972 and the US in 1978, allowing homebrewing to become a popular hobby.\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57099056ed30961900e84328\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"brewing\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 39\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57099056ed30961900e84329\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"a brewery\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 102\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57099056ed30961900e8432a\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"a brewing company\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 243\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57099056ed30961900e8432b\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"homebrewing\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 336\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57099056ed30961900e8432c\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"1963\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 647\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"The biggest change in this year's census was in racial classification.

In addition to the dollar the coinage act officially established monetary units of mill or one-thousandth of a dollar (symbol \\u20a5), cent or one-hundredth of a dollar (symbol \\u00a2), dime or one-tenth of a dollar, and eagle or ten dollars, with prescribed weights and composition of gold, silver, or copper for each. It was proposed in the mid-1800s that one hundred dollars be known as a union, but no union coins were ever struck and only patterns for the $50 half union exist. However, only cents are in everyday use as divisions of the dollar; \\\"dime\\\" is used solely as the name of the coin with the value of 10\\u00a2, while \\\"eagle\\\" and \\\"mill\\\" are largely unknown to the general public, though mills are sometimes used in matters of tax levies, and gasoline prices are usually in the form of $X.XX9 per gallon, e.g., $3.599, sometimes written as $3.599\\u204410. When currently issued in circulating form, denominations equal to or less than a dollar are emitted as U.S. coins while denominations equal to or greater than a dollar are emitted as Federal Reserve notes (with the exception of gold, silver and platinum coins valued up to $100 as legal tender, but worth far more as bullion). Both one-dollar coins and notes are produced today, although the note form is significantly more common. In the past, \\\"paper money\\\" was occasionally issued in denominations less than a dollar (fractional currency) and gold coins were issued for circulation up to the value of $20 (known as the \\\"double eagle\\\", discontinued in the 1930s). The term eagle was used in the Coinage Act of 1792 for the denomination of ten dollars, and subsequently was used in naming gold coins. Paper currency less than one dollar in denomination, known as \\\"fractional currency\\\", was also sometimes pejoratively referred to as \\\"shinplasters\\\". In 1854, James Guthrie, then Secretary of the Treasury, proposed creating $100, $50 and $25 gold coins, which were referred to as a \\\"Union\\\", \\\"Half Union\\\", and \\\"Quarter Union\\\", thus implying a denomination of 1 Union = $100.\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5709a923ed30961900e843d0\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"a decimal system of values\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 63\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5709a923ed30961900e843d1\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"how\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"one-tenth of a dollar\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 275\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5709a923ed30961900e843d2\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"how\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"one hundred dollars\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 439\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5709a923ed30961900e843d3\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"$20\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 1542\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5709a923ed30961900e843d4\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Coinage Act of 1792\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 1635\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"The Royal College of Chemistry was established by private subscription in 1845 as there was a growing awareness that practical aspects of the experimental sciences were not well taught and that in the United Kingdom the teaching of chemistry in particular had fallen behind that in Germany.

Successful vaults depend on the speed of the run, the length of the hurdle, the power the gymnast generates from the legs and shoulder girdle, the kinesthetic awareness in the air, and the speed of rotation in the case of more difficult and complex vaults.\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5709e6b24103511400d59494\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"25 meters\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 53\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5709e6b24103511400d59495\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"punching\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 215\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5709e6b24103511400d59496\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"the length of the hurdle\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 474\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5709e6b24103511400d59497\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"multiple twists and somersaults\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 363\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"570c02e4ec8fbc190045bc14\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"25 meters\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 53\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"570c02e4ec8fbc190045bc15\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"who\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"The gymnast\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 111\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"570c02e4ec8fbc190045bc16\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"a standing position\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 318\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"570c02e4ec8fbc190045bc17\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"multiple twists and somersaults\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 363\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"570c02e4ec8fbc190045bc18\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"the length of the hurdle, the power the gymnast generates from the legs and shoulder girdle, the kinesthetic awareness in the air, and the speed of rotation\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 474\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"In 1636 George, Duke of Brunswick-L\\u00fcneburg, ruler of the Brunswick-L\\u00fcneburg principality of Calenberg, moved his residence to Hanover. The Dukes of Brunswick-L\\u00fcneburg were elevated by the Holy Roman Emperor to the rank of Prince-Elector in 1692, and this elevation was confirmed by the Imperial Diet in 1708. Thus the principality was upgraded to the Electorate of Brunswick-L\\u00fcneburg, colloquially known as the Electorate of Hanover after Calenberg's capital (see also: House of Hanover). Its electors would later become monarchs of Great Britain (and from 1801, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland). The first of these was George I Louis, who acceded to the British throne in 1714. The last British monarch who ruled in Hanover was William IV. Semi-Salic law, which required succession by the male line if possible, forbade the accession of Queen Victoria in Hanover. As a male-line descendant of George I, Queen Victoria was herself a member of the House of Hanover. Her descendants, however, bore her husband's titular name of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha.

This was validated by a report by the Department of Transportation which found FAA managers had allowed Southwest Airlines to fly 46 airplanes in 2006 and 2007 that were overdue for safety inspections, ignoring concerns raised by inspectors. Audits of other airlines resulted in two airlines grounding hundreds of planes, causing thousands of flight cancellations. The House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee held hearings in April 2008. Jim Oberstar, former chairman of the committee said its investigation uncovered a pattern of regulatory abuse and widespread regulatory lapses, allowing 117 aircraft to be operated commercially although not in compliance with FAA safety rules. Oberstar said there was a \\\"culture of coziness\\\" between senior FAA officials and the airlines and \\\"a systematic breakdown\\\" in the FAA's culture that resulted in \\\"malfeasance, bordering on corruption.\\\" In 2008 the FAA proposed to fine Southwest $10.2 million for failing to inspect older planes for cracks, and in 2009 Southwest and the FAA agreed that Southwest would pay a $7.5 million penalty and would adopt new safety procedures, with the fine doubling if Southwest failed to follow through.\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"570aa91f4103511400d598ca\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"when\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"2007\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 3\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"570aa91f4103511400d598cb\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"how\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"46\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 394\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"570aa91f4103511400d598cc\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"how\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"$10.2 million\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 1200\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"570aa91f4103511400d598cd\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Jim Oberstar\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 712\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"570aa91f4103511400d598ce\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"how\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"117\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 865\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"The boroughs of Liverpool, Knowsley, St Helens and Sefton were included in Merseyside.

That month, Microsoft held an event for 400 developers in Bellevue, Washington to recruit support for the system. Also that month, Peter Moore, former president of Sega of America, joined Microsoft. On August 12, 2003, ATI signed on to produce the graphic processing unit for the new console, a deal which was publicly announced two days later. Before the launch of the Xbox 360, several Alpha development kits were spotted using Apple's Power Mac G5 hardware. This was because the system's PowerPC 970 processor running the same PowerPC architecture that the Xbox 360 would eventually run under IBM's Xenon processor. The cores of the Xenon processor were developed using a slightly modified version of the PlayStation 3's Cell Processor PPE architecture. According to David Shippy and Mickie Phipps, the IBM employees were \\\"hiding\\\" their work from Sony and Toshiba, IBM's partners in developing the Cell Processor. Jeff Minter created the music visualization program Neon which is included with the Xbox 360.\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"570b1d3d6b8089140040f71e\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"J Allard\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 227\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"570b1d3d6b8089140040f71f\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"ATI\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 456\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"570b1d3d6b8089140040f720\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"where\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Sega of America\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 401\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"570b1d3d6b8089140040f721\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Apple's Power Mac G5\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 667\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"570b1d3d6b8089140040f722\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"IBM's Xenon processor\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 833\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"Beginning in 1689, the colonies became involved in a series of wars between Great Britain and France for control of North America, the most important of which were Queen Anne's War, in which the British conquered French colony Acadia, and the final French and Indian War (1754\\u201363) when Britain was victorious over all the French colonies in North America.

It is a measure of the variety of organisms present in different ecosystems. This can refer to genetic variation, ecosystem variation, or species variation (number of species) within an area, biome, or planet. Terrestrial biodiversity tends to be greater near the equator, which seems to be the result of the warm climate and high primary productivity. Biodiversity is not distributed evenly on Earth. It is richest in the tropics. Marine biodiversity tends to be highest along coasts in the Western Pacific, where sea surface temperature is highest and in the mid-latitudinal band in all oceans. There are latitudinal gradients in species diversity. Biodiversity generally tends to cluster in hotspots, and has been increasing through time, but will be likely to slow in the future.\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"570bc0386b8089140040fa0a\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Biodiversity\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 0\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"570bc0386b8089140040fa0b\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"genetic variation, ecosystem variation, or species variation\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 352\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"570bc0386b8089140040fa0c\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Terrestrial biodiversity\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 467\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"570bc0386b8089140040fa0d\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"where\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"It is richest in the tropics.\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 659\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"570bc0386b8089140040fa0e\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"where\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"along coasts in the Western Pacific\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 729\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"Originally based on the English alphabet, ASCII encodes 128 specified characters into seven-bit integers as shown by the ASCII chart on the right.

After undergoing mastication and starch digestion, the food will be in the form of a small, round slurry mass called a bolus. It will then travel down the esophagus and into the stomach by the action of peristalsis. Gastric juice in the stomach starts protein digestion. Gastric juice mainly contains hydrochloric acid and pepsin. As these two chemicals may damage the stomach wall, mucus is secreted by the stomach, providing a slimy layer that acts as a shield against the damaging effects of the chemicals. At the same time protein digestion is occurring, mechanical mixing occurs by peristalsis, which is waves of muscular contractions that move along the stomach wall. This allows the mass of food to further mix with the digestive enzymes.\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"570be2d2ec8fbc190045bbbe\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"the action of mastication (chewing)\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 100\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"570be2d2ec8fbc190045bbbf\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"a liquid secreted by the salivary glands\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 212\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"570be2d2ec8fbc190045bbc0\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"salivary amylase\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 263\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"570be2d2ec8fbc190045bbc1\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"a small, round slurry mass\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 581\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"570be2d2ec8fbc190045bbc2\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"peristalsis\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 701\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"Hoover began using wiretapping in the 1920s during Prohibition to arrest bootleggers.

After Prohibition's repeal, Congress passed the Communications Act of 1934, which outlawed non-consensual phone tapping, but allowed bugging. In the 1939 case Nardone v. United States, the court ruled that due to the 1934 law, evidence the FBI obtained by phone tapping was inadmissible in court. After the 1967 case Katz v.

Henry II of England and Eleanor of Aquitaine on 24 December 1166. Henry had inherited significant territories along the Atlantic seaboard\\u2014Anjou, Normandy and England\\u2014and expanded his empire by conquering Brittany. Henry married the powerful Eleanor of Aquitaine, who reigned over the Duchy of Aquitaine and had a tenuous claim to Toulouse and Auvergne in southern France, in addition to being the former wife of Louis VII of France. The result was the Angevin Empire, named after Henry's paternal title as Count of Anjou and, more specifically, its seat in Angers.[nb 2] The Empire, however, was inherently fragile: although all the lands owed allegiance to Henry, the disparate parts each had their own histories, traditions and governance structures. As one moved south through Anjou and Aquitaine, the extent of Henry's power in the provinces diminished considerably, scarcely resembling the modern concept of an empire at all. Some of the traditional ties between parts of the empire such as Normandy and England were slowly dissolving over time. It was unclear what would happen to the empire on Henry's death. Although the custom of primogeniture, under which an eldest son would inherit all his father's lands, was slowly becoming more widespread across Europe, it was less popular amongst the Norman kings of England. Most believed that Henry would divide the empire, giving each son a substantial portion, and hoping that his children would continue to work together as allies after his death. To complicate matters, much of the Angevin empire was held by Henry only as a vassal of the King of France of the rival line of the House of Capet. Henry had often allied himself with the Holy Roman Emperor against France, making the feudal relationship even more challenging.\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"570c4c8ab3d812140066d093\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"when\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"24 December 1166\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 65\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"570c4c8ab3d812140066d094\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"who\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Eleanor of Aquitaine\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 258\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"570c4c8ab3d812140066d095\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"who\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Holy Roman Emperor\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 1708\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"The Macintosh, however, was expensive, which hindered its ability to be competitive in a market already dominated by the Commodore 64 for consumers, as well as the IBM Personal Computer and its accompanying clone market for businesses.

In the 1990s, improvements in the rival Wintel platform, notably with the introduction of Windows 3.0, then Windows 95, gradually took market share from the more expensive Macintosh systems. The performance advantage of 68000-based Macintosh systems was eroded by Intel's Pentium, and in 1994 Apple was relegated to third place as Compaq became the top PC manufacturer. Even after a transition to the superior PowerPC-based Power Macintosh (later renamed the PowerMac, in line with the PowerBook series) line in 1994, the falling prices of commodity PC components and the release of Windows 95 saw the Macintosh user base decline.\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"570cd0bbb3d812140066d27f\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"expensive\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 28\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"570cd0bbb3d812140066d280\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"where\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"education and desktop publishing\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 277\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"570cd0bbb3d812140066d281\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"when\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Wintel\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 424\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"570cd0bbb3d812140066d282\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"performance\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 579\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"570cd0bbb3d812140066d283\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"who\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Compaq\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 715\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"Anti-aircraft warfare or counter-air defence is defined by NATO as \\\"all measures designed to nullify or reduce the effectiveness of hostile air action.\\\" They include ground-and air-based weapon systems, associated sensor systems, command and control arrangements and passive measures (e.g. barrage balloons).

A number of European soldiers came on their own to help, such as Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben, who taught the army Prussian tactics and organizational skills.\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"570d2681fed7b91900d45c63\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"when\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"14 June 1775\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 36\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"570d2681fed7b91900d45c64\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"who\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"George Washington\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 141\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"570d2681fed7b91900d45c65\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Europe\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 457\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"570d2681fed7b91900d45c66\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Prussian tactics and organizational skills\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 561\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"The German states proclaimed their union as the German Empire under the Prussian king, Wilhelm I, uniting Germany as a nation-state.

A variety of 19th-century movements, including liberalism and neo-classicism, trace their intellectual heritage back to the Enlightenment.\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"570ec9a70b85d914000d7f9f\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"1715\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 64\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"570ec9a70b85d914000d7fa0\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"scientific revolution\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 226\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"570ec9a70b85d914000d7fa1\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"the Enlightenment.\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 760\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"570ec9a70b85d914000d7fa2\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"The Philosophes\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 249\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57103d79b654c5140001f8bb\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"1715\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 64\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57103d79b654c5140001f8bc\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"1789\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 104\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57103d79b654c5140001f8bd\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"1620s\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 197\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"Circadian rhythms allow organisms to anticipate and prepare for precise and regular environmental changes.

Direct review of a capital sentencing hearing will result in one of three outcomes. If the appellate court finds that no significant legal errors occurred in the capital sentencing hearing, the appellate court will affirm the judgment, or let the sentence stand. If the appellate court finds that significant legal errors did occur, then it will reverse the judgment, or nullify the sentence and order a new capital sentencing hearing. Lastly, if the appellate court finds that no reasonable juror could find the defendant eligible for the death penalty, a rarity, then it will order the defendant acquitted, or not guilty, of the crime for which he/she was given the death penalty, and order him sentenced to the next most severe punishment for which the offense is eligible.

Other estimates place Ashkenazi Jews as making up about 75% of Jews worldwide.\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57194aad3e985219001bc016\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"74%\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 542\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57194aad3e985219001bc017\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"11th century\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 28\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57194aad3e985219001bc018\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"which\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Holocaust\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 222\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57194aad3e985219001bc019\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"1931\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 141\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"571a5a3d10f8ca1400304feb\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"92 percent\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 165\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"571a5a3d10f8ca1400304fef\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"how\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"16.7 million\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 288\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"571a5a3d10f8ca1400304fec\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"three percent of the world's Jewish population, while at their peak in 1931 they accounted for 92 percent\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 70\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"571a5a3d10f8ca1400304fed\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"who\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Sergio DellaPergola\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 427\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"571a5a3d10f8ca1400304fee\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"which\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"10 million and 11.2 million\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 398\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"Saint Athanasius of Alexandria (/\\u02cc\\u00e6\\u03b8\\u0259\\u02c8ne\\u026a\\u0283\\u0259s/; Greek: \\u1f08\\u03b8\\u03b1\\u03bd\\u03ac\\u03c3\\u03b9\\u03bf\\u03c2 \\u1f08\\u03bb\\u03b5\\u03be\\u03b1\\u03bd\\u03b4\\u03c1\\u03b5\\u03af\\u03b1\\u03c2, Athan\\u00e1sios Alexandr\\u00edas; c. 296\\u2013298 \\u2013 2 May 373), also called Athanasius the Great, Athanasius the Confessor or, primarily in the Coptic Orthodox Church, Athanasius the Apostolic, was the twentieth bishop of Alexandria (as Athanasius I).

The blood pressure raising and vasoconstrictive effects of adrenal extracts were of particular interest to surgeons as hemostatic agents and as treatment for shock, and a number of companies developed products based on adrenal extracts containing varying purities of the active substance. In 1897 John Abel of Johns Hopkins University identified the active principle as epinephrine, which he isolated in an impure state as the sulfate salt. Industrial chemist Jokichi Takamine later developed a method for obtaining epinephrine in a pure state, and licensed the technology to Parke Davis. Parke Davis marketed epinephrine under the trade name Adrenalin. Injected epinephrine proved to be especially efficacious for the acute treatment of asthma attacks, and an inhaled version was sold in the United States until 2011 (Primatene Mist). By 1929 epinephrine had been formulated into an inhaler for use in the treatment of nasal congestion.\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"571a6dbe4faf5e1900b8a9a0\",\n

This UN plan specified borders for new Arab and Jewish states and also specified an area of Jerusalem and its environs which was to be administered by the UN under an international regime. The end of the British Mandate for Palestine was set for midnight on 14 May 1948. That day, David Ben-Gurion, the executive head of the Zionist Organization and president of the Jewish Agency for Palestine, declared \\\"the establishment of a Jewish state in Eretz Israel, to be known as the State of Israel,\\\" which would start to function from the termination of the mandate. The borders of the new state were not specified in the declaration. Neighboring Arab armies invaded the former Palestinian mandate on the next day and fought the Israeli forces. Israel has since fought several wars with neighboring Arab states, in the course of which it has occupied the West Bank, Sinai Peninsula (1956\\u201357, 1967\\u201382), part of Southern Lebanon (1982\\u20132000), Gaza Strip (1967\\u20132005; still considered occupied after 2005 disengagement) and the Golan Heights. It extended its laws to the Golan Heights and East Jerusalem, but not the West Bank. Efforts to resolve the Israeli\\u2013Palestinian conflict have not resulted in peace. However, peace treaties between Israel and both Egypt and Jordan have successfully been signed. Israel's occupation of Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem is the world's longest military occupation in modern times.[note 2]\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5725b267b80e561500fa6f28\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"when\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"29 November 1947\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 3\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5725b267b80e561500fa6f29\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"when\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"midnight on 14 May 1948\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 394\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5725b267b80e561500fa6f2a\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"who\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"David Ben-Gurion\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 429\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"The Hellenistic period covers the period of ancient Greek (Hellenic) history and Mediterranean history between the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC and the emergence of the Roman Empire as signified by the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the subsequent conquest of Ptolemaic Egypt the following year. At this time, Greek cultural influence and power was at its peak in Europe, Africa and Asia, experiencing prosperity and progress in the arts, exploration, literature, theatre, architecture, music, mathematics, philosophy, and science. For example, competitive public games took place, ideas in biology, and popular entertainment in theaters. It is often considered a period of transition, sometimes even of decadence or degeneration, compared to the enlightenment of the Greek Classical era. The Hellenistic period saw the rise of New Comedy, Alexandrian poetry, the Septuagint and the philosophies of Stoicism and Epicureanism. Greek Science was advanced by the works of the mathematician Euclid and the polymath Archimedes. The religious sphere expanded to include new gods such as the Greco-Egyptian Serapis, eastern deities such as Attis and Cybele and the Greek adoption of Buddhism.\",\n        \"qas\": [\n

Buonaparte; 15 August 1769 \\u2013 5 May 1821) was a French military and political leader who rose to prominence during the French Revolution and led several successful campaigns during the Revolutionary Wars. As Napoleon I, he was Emperor of the French from 1804 until 1814, and again in 1815. Napoleon dominated European and global affairs for more than a decade while leading France against a series of coalitions in the Napoleonic Wars. He won most of these wars and the vast majority of his battles, building a large empire that ruled over continental Europe before its final collapse in 1815. Often considered one of the greatest commanders in history, his wars and campaigns are studied at military schools worldwide. He also remains one of the most celebrated and controversial political figures in Western history. In civil affairs, Napoleon had a major long-term impact by bringing liberal reforms to the territories that he conquered, especially the Low Countries, Switzerland, and large parts of modern Italy and Germany. He implemented fundamental liberal policies in France and throughout Western Europe.[note 1] His lasting legal achievement, the Napoleonic Code, has been adopted in various forms by a quarter of the world's legal systems, from Japan to Quebec.\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5725b31769ff041400e58e32\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"the French\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 329\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5725b31769ff041400e58e33\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"when\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"1815\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 679\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5725b31769ff041400e58e34\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"where\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"military schools\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 783\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5725b31769ff041400e58e35\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"liberal reforms\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 978\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5725b31769ff041400e58e36\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"the Napoleonic Code\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 1244\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57263f11ec44d21400f3dcb9\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"when\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"15 August 1769\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 104\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57263f11ec44d21400f3dcba\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"when\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"5 May 1821\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 121\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57263f11ec44d21400f3dcbb\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"French\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 139\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57263f11ec44d21400f3dcbc\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"the French Revolution\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 206\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57263f11ec44d21400f3dcbd\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"when\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"1815\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 679\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"572649185951b619008f6f0e\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"when\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"5 May 1821\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 121\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"572649185951b619008f6f10\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"the French Revolution\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 206\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (or the Gates Foundation, abbreviated as BMGF) is the largest private foundation in the world, founded by Bill and Melinda Gates.

The word \\\"poultry\\\" comes from the French/Norman word poule, itself derived from the Latin word pullus, which means small animal.\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5725b87189a1e219009abd66\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"kept by humans for the eggs they produce, their meat, their feathers, or sometimes as pets.\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 45\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5725b87189a1e219009abd67\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"Are all domesticated and wild birds classified as poultry  ?\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"but does not include similar wild birds hunted for sport or food and known as game.\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 534\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5725b87189a1e219009abd68\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"chickens, quails and turkeys\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 264\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5725b87189a1e219009abd69\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"Was the Latin word for poultry also used to decribe other small animals as opposed to any poulty?\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"from the Latin word pullus, which means small animal.\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 693\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5725b87189a1e219009abd6a\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"Are any other birds considered common in the world of poultry?\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"domestic ducks and domestic geese.\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 386\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"Arsenal was the first club from the south of England to join The Football League, in 1893.

Ultimately sensitivity is limited by the quantum efficiency of the film or sensor.\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57263b5b38643c19005ad33b\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"sensitivity\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 560\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57263b5b38643c19005ad33c\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"slow film\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 193\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57263b5b38643c19005ad33d\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"reduction of exposure\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 308\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57263b5b38643c19005ad33e\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Highly sensitive films\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 204\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57263b5b38643c19005ad33f\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"reduced image quality\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 394\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"Mexico City, or the City of Mexico (Spanish: Ciudad de M\\u00e9xico  audio (help\\u00b7info) American Spanish: [sju\\u02c8\\u00f0a(\\u00f0) \\u00f0e \\u02c8m\\u00e9xiko]; abbreviated as \\\"CDMX\\\"), is the capital of Mexico.

Often it is in the center or left side of the chest and lasts for more than a few minutes. The discomfort may occasionally feel like heartburn. Other symptoms may include shortness of breath, nausea, feeling faint, a cold sweat, or feeling tired. About 30% of people have atypical symptoms, with women more likely than men to present atypically. Among those over 75 years old, about 5% have had an MI with little or no history of symptoms.

Mercury joined the band in 1970, suggested \\\"Queen\\\" as a new band name, and adopted his familiar stage name. John Deacon was recruited prior to recording their eponymous debut album in 1973. Queen first charted in the UK with their second album, Queen II, in 1974, but it was the release of Sheer Heart Attack later that year and A Night at the Opera in 1975 which brought them international success. The latter featured \\\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\\", which stayed at number one in the UK for nine weeks and popularised the music video. Their 1977 album, News of the World, contained \\\"We Will Rock You\\\" and \\\"We Are the Champions\\\", which have become anthems at sporting events. By the early 1980s, Queen were one of the biggest stadium rock bands in the world. Their performance at 1985's Live Aid is ranked among the greatest in rock history by various music publications, with a 2005 industry poll ranking it the best. In 1991, Mercury died of bronchopneumonia, a complication of AIDS, and Deacon retired in 1997. Since then, May and Taylor have occasionally performed together, including with Paul Rodgers (2004\\u201309) and with Adam Lambert (since 2011). In November 2014, Queen released a new album, Queen Forever, featuring vocals from the late Mercury.\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57265492f1498d1400e8dc32\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Smile\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 85\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57265492f1498d1400e8dc33\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Freddie Mercury\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 92\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57265492f1498d1400e8dc34\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Queen Forever\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 1462\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57265492f1498d1400e8dc35\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"News of the World\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 817\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57265492f1498d1400e8dc36\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"1991\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 1185\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"Presbyterianism is a part of the Reformed tradition within Protestantism which traces its origins to the British Isles.

Many Reformed churches are organized this way, but the word \\\"Presbyterian,\\\" when capitalized, is often applied uniquely to the churches that trace their roots to the Scottish and English churches that bore that name and English political groups that formed during the English Civil War. Presbyterian theology typically emphasizes the sovereignty of God, the authority of the Scriptures, and the necessity of grace through faith in Christ. Presbyterian church government was ensured in Scotland by the Acts of Union in 1707 which created the kingdom of Great Britain. In fact, most Presbyterians found in England can trace a Scottish connection, and the Presbyterian denomination was also taken to North America mostly by Scots and Scots-Irish immigrants. The Presbyterian denominations in Scotland hold to the theology of John Calvin and his immediate successors, although there are a range of theological views within contemporary Presbyterianism. Local congregations of churches which use presbyterian polity are governed by sessions made up of representatives of the congregation (elders); a conciliar approach which is found at other levels of decision-making (presbytery, synod and general assembly).\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"572655b6f1498d1400e8dc58\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"where\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"British Isles\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 105\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"572655b6f1498d1400e8dc59\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"sovereignty of God\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 601\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"572655b6f1498d1400e8dc5a\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"which\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Great Britain\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 819\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"Since the Protestant Reformation, the most prominent Christian denomination in Thuringia has been Lutheranism.

Members of the Catholic Church formed 7.8% of the population, while 68.2% of Thuringians were non-religious or adhere to other faiths.

Catholic regions are the Eichsfeld in the northwest and parts of the Rh\\u00f6n Mountains around Geisa in the southwest. Protestant church membership is shrinking rapidly, whereas the Catholic Church is somewhat more stable because of Catholic migration from Poland, Southern Europe and West Germany. Other religions play no significant role in Thuringia. There are only a few thousand Muslims (largely migrants) and about 750 Jews (mostly migrants from Russia) living in Thuringia. Furthermore, there are some Orthodox communities of Eastern European migrants and some traditional Protestant Free churches in Thuringia without any societal influence.\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57265912dd62a815002e8252\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Lutheranism\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 98\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57265912dd62a815002e8253\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"how\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Today over two thirds of the population\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 229\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57265912dd62a815002e8254\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"which\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"The Protestant Evangelical Church in Germany\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 287\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57265912dd62a815002e8255\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"how\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"7.8% of the population\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 469\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57265912dd62a815002e8256\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"how\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"750 Jews\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 1157\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"In an ecosystem, predation is a biological interaction where a predator (an organism that is hunting) feeds on its prey (the organism that is attacked). Predators may or may not kill their prey prior to feeding on them, but the act of predation often results in the death of the prey and the eventual absorption of the prey's tissue through consumption. Thus predation is often, though not always, carnivory. Other categories of consumption are herbivory (eating parts of plants), fungivory (eating parts of fungi), and detritivory (the consumption of dead organic material (detritus)). All these consumption categories fall under the rubric of consumer-resource systems. It can often be difficult to separate various types of feeding behaviors. For example, some parasitic species prey on a host organism and then lay their eggs on it for their offspring to feed on it while it continues to live in or on its decaying corpse after it has died. The key characteristic of predation however is the predator's direct impact on the prey population. On the other hand, detritivores simply eat dead organic material arising from the decay of dead individuals and have no direct impact on the \\\"donor\\\" organism(s).\",\n        \"qas\": [\n

As a result, its political, legal, linguistic and cultural legacy is widespread.

The term pesticide includes all of the following: herbicide, insecticide, insect growth regulator, nematicide, termiticide, molluscicide, piscicide, avicide, rodenticide, predacide, bactericide, insect repellent, animal repellent, antimicrobial, fungicide, disinfectant (antimicrobial), and sanitizer.\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57268054dd62a815002e8764\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"pesticides are also used for non-agricultural purposes\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 480\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57268054dd62a815002e8765\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Pesticides are substances meant for attracting, seducing, and then destroying any pest\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 0\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57268054dd62a815002e8766\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"The most common use of pesticides is as plant protection products\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 117\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57268054dd62a815002e8767\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"protect plants from damaging influences such as weeds, fungi, or insects\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 242\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57268054dd62a815002e8768\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"sanitizer\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 827\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"Somerset is a rural county of rolling hills such as the Blackdown Hills, Mendip Hills, Quantock Hills and Exmoor National Park, and large flat expanses of land including the Somerset Levels.

The major philosophies during the period, Confucianism, Legalism, Mohism, Agrarianism and Taoism, each had a political aspect to their philosophical schools. Philosophers such as Confucius, Mencius, and Mozi, focused on political unity and political stability as the basis of their political philosophies. Confucianism advocated a hierarchical, meritocratic government based on empathy, loyalty, and interpersonal relationships. Legalism advocated a highly authoritarian government based on draconian punishments and laws. Mohism advocated a communal, decentralized government centered on frugality and ascetism. The Agrarians advocated a peasant utopian communalism and egalitarianism. Taoism advocated a proto-anarchism. Legalism was the dominant political philosophy of the Qin Dynasty, but was replaced by State Confucianism in the Han Dynasty. Prior to China's adoption of communism, State Confucianism remained the dominant political philosophy of China up to the 20th century.\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"572696dff1498d1400e8e48e\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Chinese political philosophy\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 0\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"572696dff1498d1400e8e48f\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"6th century BC\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 108\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"572696dff1498d1400e8e490\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"the social and political breakdown of the country\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 184\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"572696dff1498d1400e8e491\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Mohism\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 835\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"An alloy is a mixture of metals or a mixture of a metal and another element.

Succeeding Pope John XXIII, he continued the Second Vatican Council which he closed in 1965, implementing its numerous reforms, and fostered improved ecumenical relations with Eastern Orthodox and Protestants, which resulted in many historic meetings and agreements. Montini served in the Vatican's Secretariat of State from 1922 to 1954. While in the Secretariat of State, Montini and Domenico Tardini were considered as the closest and most influential colleagues of Pope Pius XII, who in 1954 named him Archbishop of Milan, the largest Italian diocese. Montini automatically became the Secretary of the Italian Bishops Conference. John XXIII elevated him to the College of Cardinals in 1958, and after the death of John XXIII, Montini was considered one of his most likely successors.\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57269bfff1498d1400e8e4c0\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"26 September 1897\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 184\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57269bfff1498d1400e8e4c1\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"6 August 1978)\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 204\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57269bfff1498d1400e8e4c2\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"1965\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 363\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57269bfff1498d1400e8e4c3\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"when\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"21 June 1963\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 241\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57269bfff1498d1400e8e4c4\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Giovanni\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 57\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"During George's reign the break-up of the British Empire and its transition into the Commonwealth of Nations accelerated.

Though Britain and its allies were ultimately victorious in 1945, the United States and the Soviet Union rose as pre-eminent world powers and the British Empire declined. After the independence of India and Pakistan in 1947, George remained as king of both countries, but the title Emperor of India was abandoned in June 1948. Ireland formally declared itself a republic and left the Commonwealth in 1949, and India became a republic within the Commonwealth the following year. George adopted the new title of Head of the Commonwealth. He was beset by health problems in the later years of his reign.

Another advanced Nutrition Professional is a Certified Nutrition Specialist or CNS. These Board Certified Nutritionists typically specialize in obesity and chronic disease.

Paying two visits to the archipelago, Berm\\u00fadez never landed on the islands, but did create a recognisable map of the archipelago.

Subsequent Spanish or other European parties are believed to have released pigs there, which had become feral and abundant on the island by the time European settlement began.

The conductors can be thin films, foils or sintered beads of metal or conductive electrolyte, etc. The nonconducting dielectric acts to increase the capacitor's charge capacity. Materials commonly used as dielectrics include glass, ceramic, plastic film, air, vacuum, paper, mica, and oxide layers.

Historiography of science, in contrast, often draws on the historical methods of both intellectual history and social history.\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5726eab6f1498d1400e8efcc\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"The history of science\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 0\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5726eab6f1498d1400e8efcd\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"the history of scholarship\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 202\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5726eab6f1498d1400e8efce\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"real world\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 410\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5726eab6f1498d1400e8efcf\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Historiography of science\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 432\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"Czech (/\\u02c8t\\u0283\\u025bk/; \\u010de\\u0161tina Czech pronunciation: [\\u02c8t\\u0361\\u0283\\u025b\\u0283c\\u026ana]), formerly known as Bohemian (/bo\\u028a\\u02c8hi\\u02d0mi\\u0259n, b\\u0259-/; lingua Bohemica in Latin), is a West Slavic language strongly influenced by Latin and German language, spoken by over 10 million people and it is the official language of the Czech Republic.

Glaciers slowly deform and flow due to stresses induced by their weight, creating crevasses, seracs, and other distinguishing features. They also abrade rock and debris from their substrate to create landforms such as cirques and moraines.

The ultimate objective of the textual critic's work is the production of a \\\"critical edition\\\" containing a scholarly curated text.\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"572773f6708984140094dded\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"a manuscript copy, several or many copies, but not the original document\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 263\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"572773f6708984140094ddee\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"the production of a \\\"critical edition\\\" containing a scholarly curated text.\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 642\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"572773f6708984140094ddef\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"philology\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 54\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"572773f6708984140094ddf0\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"Why are there differences in ancient copies of the same text?\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Ancient scribes made alterations when copying manuscripts by hand\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 190\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"572773f6708984140094ddf1\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"recensions\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 536\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"A gramophone record (phonograph record in American English) or vinyl record, commonly known as a \\\"record\\\", is an analogue sound storage medium in the form of a flat polyvinyl chloride (previously shellac) disc with an inscribed, modulated spiral groove.

The term is also used, albeit rarely, as a synonym for alla breve.\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"572782eb5951b619008f8bc1\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"in the manner of the chapel\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 39\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"572782eb5951b619008f8bc2\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"alla breve\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 649\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"572782eb5951b619008f8bc3\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"19th century\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 385\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"572782eb5951b619008f8bc4\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"how\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"group or solo singing without instrumental accompaniment\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 91\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"572782eb5951b619008f8bc5\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"which\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Renaissance polyphony and Baroque concertato\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 326\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"The Order of Preachers (Latin: Ordo Praedicatorum, hence the abbreviation OP used by members), more commonly known after the 15th century as the Dominican Order or Dominicans, is a Roman Catholic religious order founded by the Spanish priest Saint Dominic de Guzman in France and approved by Pope Honorius III (1216\\u201327) on 22 December 1216.

The games can be held between separate teams or between parts of the same team.\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5727b9623acd2414000dea9f\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"exhibition game\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 3\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5727b9623acd2414000deaa0\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"exhibition game\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 3\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5727b9623acd2414000deaa1\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"exhibition game\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 3\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5727b9623acd2414000deaa2\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"exhibition game\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 3\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5727b9623acd2414000deaa3\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"exhibition game\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 3\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"Strasbourg (/\\u02c8str\\u00e6zb\\u025c\\u02d0r\\u0261/, French pronunciation: \\u200b[st\\u0281az.bu\\u0281, st\\u0281as.bu\\u0281]; Alsatian: Strossburi; German: Stra\\u00dfburg, [\\u02c8\\u0283t\\u0281a\\u02d0sb\\u028a\\u0250\\u032fk]) is the capital and largest city of the Alsace-Champagne-Ardenne-Lorraine (ACAL) region in eastern France and is the official seat of the European Parliament.

Oklahoma is the 20th most extensive and the 28th most populous of the 50 United States. The state's name is derived from the Choctaw words okla and humma, meaning \\\"red people\\\". It is also known informally by its nickname, The Sooner State, in reference to the non-Native settlers who staked their claims on the choicest pieces of land before the official opening date, and the Indian Appropriations Act of 1889, which opened the door for white settlement in America's Indian Territory. The name was settled upon statehood, Oklahoma Territory and Indian Territory were merged and Indian was dropped from the name. On November 16, 1907, Oklahoma became the 46th state to enter the union. Its residents are known as Oklahomans, or informally \\\"Okies\\\", and its capital and largest city is Oklahoma City.\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5727cbc3ff5b5019007d9564\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Asgaya gigageyi\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 36\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5727cbc3ff5b5019007d9565\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Uukuhu\\u00fawa\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 106\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5727cbc3ff5b5019007d9566\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Gahnawiyo\\u02c0geh\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 125\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5727cbc3ff5b5019007d9567\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"where\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"28th\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 239\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5727cbc3ff5b5019007d9568\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"The Sooner State\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 417\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"The history of India includes the prehistoric settlements and societies in the Indian subcontinent;

Its successor, the PlayStation 4, was released later in November 2013.\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5728027d3acd2414000df20d\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"2006\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 86\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5728027d3acd2414000df20e\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"PlayStation Network\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 314\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5728027d3acd2414000df20f\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Slim\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 493\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5728027d3acd2414000df210\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"2012\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 752\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5728027d3acd2414000df211\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"how\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"85 million\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 845\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"Royal assent is sometimes associated with elaborate ceremonies.

According to Wilson, an early reference to the word \\\"samurai\\\" appears in the Kokin Wakash\\u016b (905\\u2013914), the first imperial anthology of poems, completed in the first part of the 10th century.\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5728ea364b864d1900165084\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"translator\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 94\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5728ea364b864d1900165085\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"bushi (\\u6b66\\u58eb?, [bu.\\u0255i]) or buke (\\u6b66\\u5bb6?)\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 45\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5728ea364b864d1900165086\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"where\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Kokin Wakash\\u016b\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 556\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5728ea364b864d1900165087\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"when\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"905\\u2013914\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 571\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"As the number of possible tests for even simple software components is practically infinite, all software testing uses some strategy to select tests that are feasible for the available time and resources.

Glass will transmit, reflect and refract light; these qualities can be enhanced by cutting and polishing to make optical lenses, prisms, fine glassware, and optical fibers for high speed data transmission by light. Glass can be colored by adding metallic salts, and can also be painted and printed with vitreous enamels. These qualities have led to the extensive use of glass in the manufacture of art objects and in particular, stained glass windows. Although brittle, silicate glass is extremely durable, and many examples of glass fragments exist from early glass-making cultures. Because glass can be formed or molded into any shape, and also because it is a sterile product, it has been traditionally used for vessels: bowls, vases, bottles, jars and drinking glasses. In its most solid forms it has also been used for paperweights, marbles, and beads. When extruded as glass fiber and matted as glass wool in a way to trap air, it becomes a thermal insulating material, and when these glass fibers are embedded into an organic polymer plastic, they are a key structural reinforcement part of the composite material fiberglass. Some objects historically were so commonly made of silicate glass that they are simply called by the name of the material, such as drinking glasses and reading glasses.\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5729114e3f37b31900477ff5\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"metallic salts\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 399\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5729114e3f37b31900477ff6\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"organic polymer plastic\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 1178\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5729114e3f37b31900477ff7\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"transparency\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 64\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5729114e3f37b31900477ff8\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"optical fibers\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 310\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5729114e3f37b31900477ff9\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"thermal insulating material\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 1100\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"Public policy and political leadership helps to \\\"level the playing field\\\" and drive the wider acceptance of renewable energy technologies.

Zinc production includes froth flotation of the ore, roasting, and final extraction using electricity (electrowinning).\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57296e7e6aef051400154e84\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Zn\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 39\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57296e7e6aef051400154e85\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"30\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 60\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57296e7e6aef051400154e86\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"magnesium\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 170\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57296e7e6aef051400154e87\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"+2\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 247\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57296e7e6aef051400154e88\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"how\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"five\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 315\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"572b4999be1ee31400cb8301\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Zn\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 39\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"572b4999be1ee31400cb8302\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"30\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 60\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"572b4999be1ee31400cb8303\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"magnesium\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 170\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"572b4999be1ee31400cb8304\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"sphalerite\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 365\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"572b4999be1ee31400cb8305\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"electricity\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 587\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"Many early 19th-century neoclassical architects were influenced by the drawings and projects of \\u00c9tienne-Louis Boull\\u00e9e and Claude Nicolas Ledoux.

Artists embraced electronic music, black dance styles and the avant-garde, as well as novel recording technology and production techniques. The movement also saw the frequent intersection of music with art and politics, as artists liberally drew on sources such as critical theory, cinema, performance art and modernist literature.

For his contributions to the development of quantum electrodynamics, Feynman, jointly with Julian Schwinger and Sin-Itiro Tomonaga, received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1965. He developed a widely used pictorial representation scheme for the mathematical expressions governing the behavior of subatomic particles, which later became known as Feynman diagrams. During his lifetime, Feynman became one of the best-known scientists in the world. In a 1999 poll of 130 leading physicists worldwide by the British journal Physics World he was ranked as one of the ten greatest physicists of all time.\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"572e7b47c246551400ce4236\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"parton model\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 347\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"572e7b47c246551400ce4237\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"who\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Julian Schwinger and Sin-Itiro Tomonaga\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 452\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"572e7b47c246551400ce4238\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"1965\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 532\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"572e7b47c246551400ce4239\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Feynman diagrams\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 705\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"572e7b47c246551400ce423a\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"ranked as one of the ten greatest physicists of all time\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 901\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"Muammar Muhammad Abu Minyar al-Gaddafi (Arabic: \\u0645\\u0639\\u0645\\u0631 \\u0645\\u062d\\u0645\\u062f \\u0623\\u0628\\u0648 \\u0645\\u0646\\u064a\\u0627\\u0631 \\u0627\\u0644\\u0642\\u0630\\u0627\\u0641\\u064a\\u200e Arabic pronunciation: [mu\\u0295amar al.qa\\u00f0a\\u02d0fi\\u02d0]; /\\u02c8mo\\u028a.\\u0259m\\u0251\\u02d0r \\u0261\\u0259\\u02c8d\\u0251\\u02d0fi/;  audio (help\\u00b7info); c.\\u20091942 \\u2013 20 October 2011), commonly known as Colonel Gaddafi,[b] was a Libyan revolutionary, politician, and political theorist.

Different systems are used for urban and intercity areas; some electric locomotives can switch to different supply voltages to allow flexibility in operation.\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"572e8592dfa6aa1500f8d097\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"maintenance\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 300\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"572e8592dfa6aa1500f8d098\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"how\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"can switch to different supply voltages\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 482\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"572e8592dfa6aa1500f8d09a\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"freight and passenger traffic\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 367\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"572e8592dfa6aa1500f8d099\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"significant capital expenditure\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 188\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"The Spanish language is the second most spoken language in the United States.

International relations theorists have posited that great power status can be characterized into power capabilities, spatial aspects, and status dimensions. Sometimes the status of great powers is formally recognized in conferences such as the Congress of Vienna or an international structure such as the United Nations Security Council (China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States serve as the body's five permanent members). At the same time the status of great powers can be informally recognized in a forum such as the G7 which consists of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America.\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"572ea7e9dfa6aa1500f8d265\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"A great power\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 0\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"572ea7e9dfa6aa1500f8d266\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"military and economic strength\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 172\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"572ea7e9dfa6aa1500f8d268\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"United Nations Security Council\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 671\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"572ea7e9dfa6aa1500f8d267\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"diplomatic and soft power influence\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 215\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"572ea7e9dfa6aa1500f8d269\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"the G7\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 905\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5730d9efb54a4f140068ccac\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"military and economic strength, as well as diplomatic and soft power influence\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 172\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5730d9efb54a4f140068ccad\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 704\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5730d9efb54a4f140068ccae\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 930\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5730d9efb54a4f140068ccaf\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"power capabilities, spatial aspects, and status dimensions\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 463\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"From 1989 through 1996, the total area of the US was listed as 9,372,610 km2 (3,618,780 sq mi) (land + inland water only).

It was during this period that Rome's control expanded from the city's immediate surroundings to hegemony over the entire Mediterranean world. During the first two centuries of its existence, the Roman Republic expanded through a combination of conquest and alliance, from central Italy to the entire Italian peninsula. By the following century, it included North Africa, Spain, and what is now southern France. Two centuries after that, towards the end of the 1st century BC, it included the rest of modern France, Greece, and much of the eastern Mediterranean. By this time, internal tensions led to a series of civil wars, culminating with the assassination of Julius Caesar, which led to the transition from republic to empire. The exact date of transition can be a matter of interpretation. Historians have variously proposed Julius Caesar's crossing of the Rubicon River in 49 BC, Caesar's appointment as dictator for life in 44 BC, and the defeat of Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC. However, most use the same date as did the ancient Romans themselves, the Roman Senate's grant of extraordinary powers to Octavian and his adopting the title Augustus in 27 BC, as the defining event ending the Republic.\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"572fb719b2c2fd14005683a7\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"when\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"509 BC\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 215\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"572fb719b2c2fd14005683a8\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"when\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"27 BC\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 237\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"572fb719b2c2fd14005683a9\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"the overthrow of the Roman Kingdom\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 156\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"572fb719b2c2fd14005683aa\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"when\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"31 BC\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 1297\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"572fb719b2c2fd14005683ab\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Roman Senate's grant of extraordinary powers to Octavian\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 1378\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"It is generally considered that the Pacific War began on 7/8 December 1941, on which date Japan invaded Thailand and attacked the British possessions of Malaya, Singapore, and Hong Kong as well as the United States military bases in Hawaii, Wake Island, Guam and the Philippines.

Professor Juris Zarins believes the Sumerians were settled along the coast of Eastern Arabia, today's Persian Gulf region, before it flooded at the end of the Ice Age.\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5730a6cd2461fd1900a9cf4f\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"substrate language\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 78\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5730a6cd2461fd1900a9cf50\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"who\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"hunter and fisher peoples\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 194\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5730a6cd2461fd1900a9cf51\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"where\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"marshland\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 238\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5730a6cd2461fd1900a9cf52\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Arabian bifacial\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 309\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5730a6cd2461fd1900a9cf53\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"when\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"26th century BC\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 462\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"Tuvalu (i/tu\\u02d0\\u02c8v\\u0251\\u02d0lu\\u02d0/ too-VAH-loo or /\\u02c8tu\\u02d0v\\u0259lu\\u02d0/ TOO-v\\u0259-loo), formerly known as the Ellice Islands, is a Polynesian island nation located in the Pacific Ocean, midway between Hawaii and Australia.

Mosaic art flourished in the Byzantine Empire from the 6th to the 15th centuries; that tradition was adopted by the Norman kingdom in Sicily in the 12th century, by eastern-influenced Venice, and among the Rus in Ukraine. Mosaic fell out of fashion in the Renaissance, though artists like Raphael continued to practise the old technique.

Priests married, raised families, and led politically active lives. Julius Caesar became pontifex maximus before he was elected consul. The augurs read the will of the gods and supervised the marking of boundaries as a reflection of universal order, thus sanctioning Roman expansionism as a matter of divine destiny. The Roman triumph was at its core a religious procession in which the victorious general displayed his piety and his willingness to serve the public good by dedicating a portion of his spoils to the gods, especially Jupiter, who embodied just rule. As a result of the Punic Wars (264\\u2013146 BC), when Rome struggled to establish itself as a dominant power, many new temples were built by magistrates in fulfillment of a vow to a deity for assuring their military success.\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57318c85a5e9cc1400cdc03b\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"elite\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 63\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57318c85a5e9cc1400cdc03e\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"which\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Jupiter\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 822\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57318c85a5e9cc1400cdc03d\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"509\\u201327 BC\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 189\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57318c85a5e9cc1400cdc03c\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"church and state\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 128\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57318c85a5e9cc1400cdc03f\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Punic Wars\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 874\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"YouTube is a global video-sharing website headquartered in San Bruno, California, United States.

In modern times, humanist movements are typically aligned with secularism, and today humanism typically refers to a non-theistic life stance centred on human agency and looking to science rather than revelation from a supernatural source to understand the world.\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57327732b9d445190005eb3f\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"human beings\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 87\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57327732b9d445190005eb40\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"freedom and progress\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 470\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57327732b9d445190005eb42\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"intellectual movements\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 329\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57327732b9d445190005eb41\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"secularism\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 555\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57327732b9d445190005eb43\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"science\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 672\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"Earth was initially molten due to extreme volcanism and frequent collisions with other bodies.

The aim of the Genocide Convention is to prevent the intentional destruction of entire human groups, and the part targeted must be significant enough to have an impact on the group as a whole.\\\" The Appeals Chamber goes into details of other cases and the opinions of respected commentators on the Genocide Convention to explain how they came to this conclusion.\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5733bdc4d058e614000b61a3\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"which\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"entire human groups\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 629\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5733bdc4d058e614000b61a4\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"that group\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 537\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5733bdc4d058e614000b61a1\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"which\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"\\\"in whole or in part\\\"\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 11\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5733bdc4d058e614000b61a2\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Prosecutor v.

Emergence of resistance often reflects evolutionary processes that take place during antibiotic therapy. The antibiotic treatment may select for bacterial strains with physiologically or genetically enhanced capacity to survive high doses of antibiotics. Under certain conditions, it may result in preferential growth of resistant bacteria, while growth of susceptible bacteria is inhibited by the drug. For example, antibacterial selection for strains having previously acquired antibacterial-resistance genes was demonstrated in 1943 by the Luria\\u2013Delbr\\u00fcck experiment. Antibiotics such as penicillin and erythromycin, which used to have a high efficacy against many bacterial species and strains, have become less effective, due to the increased resistance of many bacterial strains.\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5733bc38d058e614000b6187\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"resistance of bacteria\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 17\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5733bc38d058e614000b6188\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"evolution\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 118\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5733bc38d058e614000b6189\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"when\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"1943\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 610\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5733bc38d058e614000b618a\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"which\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"penicillin and erythromycin\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 669\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5731c593e17f3d14004223c5\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"evolutionary processes\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 118\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5731c593e17f3d14004223c6\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"survive high doses of antibiotics\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 299\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5731c593e17f3d14004223c7\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"when\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"1943\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 610\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5731c593e17f3d14004223c8\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"who\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Luria\\u2013Delbr\\u00fcck\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 622\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"Fr\\u00e9d\\u00e9ric Fran\\u00e7ois Chopin (/\\u02c8\\u0283o\\u028ap\\u00e6n/; French pronunciation: \\u200b[f\\u0281e.de.\\u0281ik f\\u0281\\u0251\\u0303.swa \\u0283\\u0254.p\\u025b\\u0303]; 22 February or 1 March 1810 \\u2013 17 October 1849), born Fryderyk Franciszek Chopin,[n 1] was a Polish and French (by citizenship and birth of father) composer and a virtuoso pianist of the Romantic era, who wrote primarily for the solo piano.

Analysis of the relationship is further complicated by modern political conflicts and the application of Westphalian sovereignty to a time when the concept did not exist. Some Mainland Chinese scholars, such as Wang Jiawei and Nyima Gyaincain, assert that the Ming dynasty had unquestioned sovereignty over Tibet, pointing to the Ming court's issuing of various titles to Tibetan leaders, Tibetans' full acceptance of these titles, and a renewal process for successors of these titles that involved traveling to the Ming capital. Scholars within China also argue that Tibet has been an integral part of China since the 13th century and that it was thus a part of the Ming Empire. But most scholars outside China, such as Turrell V. Wylie, Melvin C. Goldstein, and Helmut Hoffman, say that the relationship was one of suzerainty, that Ming titles were only nominal, that Tibet remained an independent region outside Ming control, and that it simply paid tribute until the Jiajing Emperor (1521\\u20131566), who ceased relations with Tibet.\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56cc239e6d243a140015eeb7\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"who\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Mainland Chinese scholars\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 274\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"The iPod is a line of portable media players and multi-purpose pocket computers designed and marketed by Apple Inc.

However, G\\u00f6del could not have come to this conclusion without Whitehead and Russell's book. In this way, Principia Mathematica's legacy might be described as its key role in disproving the possibility of achieving its own stated goals.

Proper lighting can enhance task performance, improve the appearance of an area, or have positive psychological effects on occupants.\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56de0fef4396321400ee2583\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Daylighting\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 245\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56de0fef4396321400ee2584\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"positive\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 597\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56de0fef4396321400ee2585\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"energy consumption\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 475\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56de0fef4396321400ee2586\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"artificial light sources\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 134\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56de0fef4396321400ee2587\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"The use of light to achieve an aesthetic effect is know as?\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Lighting or illumination\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 0\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56de1377cffd8e1900b4b5b2\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Daylighting\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 245\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56de1377cffd8e1900b4b5b3\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Lighting\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 0\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56de1377cffd8e1900b4b5b4\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"positive\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 597\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56de1377cffd8e1900b4b5b5\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"energy consumption\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 475\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56de1377cffd8e1900b4b5b6\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Lighting or illumination\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 0\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"Separation of powers is a political doctrine originating in the writings of Montesquieu in The Spirit of the Laws where he urged for a constitutional government with three separate branches of government.

This philosophy heavily influenced the writing of the United States Constitution, according to which the Legislative, Executive, and Judicial branches of the United States government are kept distinct in order to prevent abuse of power.

It had its origins in the missile-based nuclear arms race between the two nations that occurred following World War II, enabled by captured German rocket technology and personnel. The technological superiority required for such supremacy was seen as necessary for national security, and symbolic of ideological superiority. The Space Race spawned pioneering efforts to launch artificial satellites, unmanned space probes of the Moon, Venus, and Mars, and human spaceflight in low Earth orbit and to the Moon. The competition began on August 2, 1955, when the Soviet Union responded to the US announcement four days earlier of intent to launch artificial satellites for the International Geophysical Year, by declaring they would also launch a satellite \\\"in the near future\\\". The Soviet Union beat the US to this, with the October 4, 1957 orbiting of Sputnik 1, and later beat the US to the first human in space, Yuri Gagarin, on April 12, 1961. The Space Race peaked with the July 20, 1969 US landing of the first humans on the Moon with Apollo 11. The USSR tried but failed manned lunar missions, and eventually cancelled them and concentrated on Earth orbital space stations.

In all three traditions, a canon was originally a rule adopted by a church council; these canons formed the foundation of canon law.\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56e0f09d231d4119001ac476\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Canon law\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 0\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56e0f09d231d4119001ac477\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Christian\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 124\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56e0f09d231d4119001ac478\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"which\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Latin Church and Eastern Catholic Churches\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 248\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56e0f09d231d4119001ac479\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"church council\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 606\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56e0f09d231d4119001ac47a\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"canons\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 628\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"Communications in Somalia encompasses the communications services and capacity of Somalia.

Additionally, the national postal service is slated to be officially relaunched in 2013 after a long absence.

The building itself is the original abbey church.\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56e6dcc16fe0821900b8ebfc\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Collegiate Church of St Peter at Westminster\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 39\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56e6dcc16fe0821900b8ebfd\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Gothic\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 104\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56e6dcc16fe0821900b8ebfe\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"City of Westminster, London\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 131\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56e6dcc16fe0821900b8ebff\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Between 1540 and 1556\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 394\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56e6dcc16fe0821900b8ec00\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Royal Peculiar\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 580\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56e8ceee99e8941900975ea5\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"the Collegiate Church of St Peter at Westminster\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 35\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56e8ceee99e8941900975ea6\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"where\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"City of Westminster, London\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 131\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56e8ceee99e8941900975ea8\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"when\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Between 1540 and 1556\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 394\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56e8ceee99e8941900975ea9\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Church of England \\\"Royal Peculiar\\\"\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 561\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"Nanjing ( listen; Chinese: \\u5357\\u4eac, \\\"Southern Capital\\\") is the city situated in the heartland of lower Yangtze River region in China, which has long been a major centre of culture, education, research, politics, economy, transport networks and tourism. It is the capital city of Jiangsu province of People's Republic of China and the second largest city in East China, with a total population of 8,216,100, and legally the capital of Republic of China which lost the mainland during the civil war. The city whose name means \\\"Southern Capital\\\" has a prominent place in Chinese history and culture, having served as the capitals of various Chinese dynasties, kingdoms and republican governments dating from the 3rd century AD to 1949. Prior to the advent of pinyin romanization, Nanjing's city name was spelled as Nanking or Nankin. Nanjing has a number of other names, and some historical names are now used as names of districts of the city, and among them there is the name Jiangning (\\u6c5f\\u5be7), whose former character Jiang (\\u6c5f, River) is the former part of the name Jiangsu and latter character Ning (\\u5be7, simplified form \\u5b81, Peace) is the short name of Nanjing. When being the capital of a state, for instance, ROC, Jing (\\u4eac) is adopted as the abbreviation of Nanjing. Although as a city located in southern part of China becoming Chinese national capital as early as in Jin dynasty, the name Nanjing was designated to the city in Ming dynasty, about a thousand years later.

The major time divisions of classical music are as follows: the early music period, which includes the Medieval (500\\u20131400) and the Renaissance (1400\\u20131600) eras; the Common practice period, which includes the Baroque (1600\\u20131750), Classical (1750\\u20131820), and Romantic eras (1804\\u20131910); and the 20th century (1901\\u20132000) which includes the modern (1890\\u20131930) that overlaps from the late 19th-century, the high modern (mid 20th-century), and contemporary or postmodern (1975\\u20132015) eras.[citation needed]\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56f6e729711bf01900a44858\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"the Classical period\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 217\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56f6e729711bf01900a44859\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"1400\\u20131600\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 663\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56f6e729711bf01900a4485a\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"1600\\u20131750\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 736\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56f6e729711bf01900a4485b\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Romantic\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 775\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56f6e729711bf01900a4485c\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Western music\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 69\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56f6ed94711bf01900a44874\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Western\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 69\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56f6ed94711bf01900a44875\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"the Classical period\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 217\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56f6ed94711bf01900a44876\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"between 1550 and 1900\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 450\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56f6ed94711bf01900a44877\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"when\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"1400\\u20131600\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 663\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56f6ed94711bf01900a44878\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"when\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"1890\\u20131930\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 862\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"Slavs are the largest Indo-European ethno-linguistic group in Europe.

During World War II he was the leader of the Partisans, often regarded as the most effective resistance movement in occupied Europe. While his presidency has been criticized as authoritarian, and concerns about the repression of political opponents have been raised, Tito was \\\"seen by most as a benevolent dictator\\\" due to his economic and diplomatic policies. He was a popular public figure both in Yugoslavia and abroad. Viewed as a unifying symbol, his internal policies maintained the peaceful coexistence of the nations of the Yugoslav federation. He gained further international attention as the chief leader of the Non-Aligned Movement, working with Jawaharlal Nehru of India, Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt and Sukarno of Indonesia.\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56f71177711bf01900a4490a\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"1980\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 221\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56f71177711bf01900a4490b\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"the Partisans,\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 268\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56f71177711bf01900a4490c\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Yugoslavia\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 627\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56f71177711bf01900a4490d\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"which\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Gamal Abdel Nasser\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 911\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56f71177711bf01900a4490e\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"which\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Sukarno\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 943\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"The Marshall Islands, officially the Republic of the Marshall Islands (Marshallese: Aolep\\u0101n Aor\\u014dkin M\\u0327aje\\u013c),[note 1] is an island country located near the equator in the Pacific Ocean, slightly west of the International Date Line.

The Caucasus Mountains are higher, and the Urals longer, but both lie partly in Asia. The mountains were formed over tens of millions of years as the African and Eurasian tectonic plates collided. Extreme shortening caused by the event resulted in marine sedimentary rocks rising by thrusting and folding into high mountain peaks such as Mont Blanc and the Matterhorn. Mont Blanc spans the French\\u2013Italian border, and at 4,810 m (15,781 ft) is the highest mountain in the Alps.

The Allen brothers decided to name the city after Sam Houston, the popular general at the Battle of San Jacinto, who was elected President of Texas in September 1836. The great majority of slaves in Texas came with their owners from the older slave states. Sizable numbers, however, came through the domestic slave trade. New Orleans was the center of this trade in the Deep South, but there were slave dealers in Houston. Thousands of enslaved African-Americans lived near the city before the Civil War. Many of them near the city worked on sugar and cotton plantations, while most of those in the city limits had domestic and artisan jobs. In 1860 forty-nine percent of the city's population was enslaved. A few slaves, perhaps as many as 2,000 between 1835 and 1865, came through the illegal African trade. Post-war Texas grew rapidly as migrants poured into the cotton lands of the state. They also brought or purchased enslaved African Americans, whose numbers nearly tripled in the state from 1850 to 1860, from 58,000 to 182,566.\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57093943efce8f15003a7dba\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"where\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"New York\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 95\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57093943efce8f15003a7dbb\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"how\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"6,642\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 115\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57093943efce8f15003a7dbc\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"founding a city\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 186\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57093943efce8f15003a7dbd\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"who\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Sam Houston\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 253\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57093943efce8f15003a7dbe\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"1836\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 364\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5709aeceed30961900e84408\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"who\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Allen brothers\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 207\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5709aeceed30961900e84409\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"how\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"6,642 acres\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 115\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5709aeceed30961900e8440a\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"which\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Sam Houston\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 253\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5709aeceed30961900e8440b\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"forty-nine percent\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 853\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5709aeceed30961900e8440c\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"how\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"tripled\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 1176\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"In the Roman era, copper was principally mined on Cyprus, the origin of the name of the metal from aes \\u0441yprium (metal of Cyprus), later corrupted to \\u0441uprum, from which the words copper (English), cuivre (French), Koper (Dutch) and Kupfer (German) are all derived.

Speech also contains nonverbal elements known as paralanguage, e.g. rhythm, intonation, tempo, and stress. There may even be a pheromone component. Research has shown that up to 55% of human communication may occur through non-verbal facial expressions, and a further 38% through paralanguage. It affects communication most at the subconscious level and establishes trust. Likewise, written texts include nonverbal elements such as handwriting style, spatial arrangement of words and the use of emoticons to convey emotion.\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57096026ed30961900e84018\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"conveying meaning in the form of non-word messages\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 49\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57096026ed30961900e84019\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"body language\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 202\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57096026ed30961900e8401a\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"shaking a hand\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 392\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57096026ed30961900e8401b\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"sweating\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 451\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57096026ed30961900e8401c\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"55%\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 639\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"Grapes are a type of fruit that grow in clusters of 15 to 300, and can be crimson, black, dark blue, yellow, green, orange, and pink. \\\"White\\\" grapes are actually green in color, and are evolutionarily derived from the purple grape.

However, the UK government relaxed legislation in 1963, followed by Australia in 1972 and the US in 1978, allowing homebrewing to become a popular hobby.\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57099056ed30961900e84328\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"brewing\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 39\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57099056ed30961900e84329\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"a brewery\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 102\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57099056ed30961900e8432a\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"a brewing company\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 243\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57099056ed30961900e8432b\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"homebrewing\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 336\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57099056ed30961900e8432c\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"1963\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 647\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"The biggest change in this year's census was in racial classification.

In addition to the dollar the coinage act officially established monetary units of mill or one-thousandth of a dollar (symbol \\u20a5), cent or one-hundredth of a dollar (symbol \\u00a2), dime or one-tenth of a dollar, and eagle or ten dollars, with prescribed weights and composition of gold, silver, or copper for each. It was proposed in the mid-1800s that one hundred dollars be known as a union, but no union coins were ever struck and only patterns for the $50 half union exist. However, only cents are in everyday use as divisions of the dollar; \\\"dime\\\" is used solely as the name of the coin with the value of 10\\u00a2, while \\\"eagle\\\" and \\\"mill\\\" are largely unknown to the general public, though mills are sometimes used in matters of tax levies, and gasoline prices are usually in the form of $X.XX9 per gallon, e.g., $3.599, sometimes written as $3.599\\u204410. When currently issued in circulating form, denominations equal to or less than a dollar are emitted as U.S. coins while denominations equal to or greater than a dollar are emitted as Federal Reserve notes (with the exception of gold, silver and platinum coins valued up to $100 as legal tender, but worth far more as bullion). Both one-dollar coins and notes are produced today, although the note form is significantly more common. In the past, \\\"paper money\\\" was occasionally issued in denominations less than a dollar (fractional currency) and gold coins were issued for circulation up to the value of $20 (known as the \\\"double eagle\\\", discontinued in the 1930s). The term eagle was used in the Coinage Act of 1792 for the denomination of ten dollars, and subsequently was used in naming gold coins. Paper currency less than one dollar in denomination, known as \\\"fractional currency\\\", was also sometimes pejoratively referred to as \\\"shinplasters\\\". In 1854, James Guthrie, then Secretary of the Treasury, proposed creating $100, $50 and $25 gold coins, which were referred to as a \\\"Union\\\", \\\"Half Union\\\", and \\\"Quarter Union\\\", thus implying a denomination of 1 Union = $100.\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5709a923ed30961900e843d0\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"a decimal system of values\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 63\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5709a923ed30961900e843d1\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"how\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"one-tenth of a dollar\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 275\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5709a923ed30961900e843d2\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"how\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"one hundred dollars\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 439\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5709a923ed30961900e843d3\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"$20\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 1542\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5709a923ed30961900e843d4\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Coinage Act of 1792\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 1635\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"The Royal College of Chemistry was established by private subscription in 1845 as there was a growing awareness that practical aspects of the experimental sciences were not well taught and that in the United Kingdom the teaching of chemistry in particular had fallen behind that in Germany.

Successful vaults depend on the speed of the run, the length of the hurdle, the power the gymnast generates from the legs and shoulder girdle, the kinesthetic awareness in the air, and the speed of rotation in the case of more difficult and complex vaults.\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5709e6b24103511400d59494\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"25 meters\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 53\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5709e6b24103511400d59495\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"punching\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 215\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5709e6b24103511400d59496\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"the length of the hurdle\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 474\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5709e6b24103511400d59497\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"multiple twists and somersaults\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 363\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"570c02e4ec8fbc190045bc14\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"25 meters\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 53\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"570c02e4ec8fbc190045bc15\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"who\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"The gymnast\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 111\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"570c02e4ec8fbc190045bc16\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"a standing position\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 318\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"570c02e4ec8fbc190045bc17\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"multiple twists and somersaults\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 363\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"570c02e4ec8fbc190045bc18\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"the length of the hurdle, the power the gymnast generates from the legs and shoulder girdle, the kinesthetic awareness in the air, and the speed of rotation\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 474\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"In 1636 George, Duke of Brunswick-L\\u00fcneburg, ruler of the Brunswick-L\\u00fcneburg principality of Calenberg, moved his residence to Hanover. The Dukes of Brunswick-L\\u00fcneburg were elevated by the Holy Roman Emperor to the rank of Prince-Elector in 1692, and this elevation was confirmed by the Imperial Diet in 1708. Thus the principality was upgraded to the Electorate of Brunswick-L\\u00fcneburg, colloquially known as the Electorate of Hanover after Calenberg's capital (see also: House of Hanover). Its electors would later become monarchs of Great Britain (and from 1801, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland). The first of these was George I Louis, who acceded to the British throne in 1714. The last British monarch who ruled in Hanover was William IV. Semi-Salic law, which required succession by the male line if possible, forbade the accession of Queen Victoria in Hanover. As a male-line descendant of George I, Queen Victoria was herself a member of the House of Hanover. Her descendants, however, bore her husband's titular name of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha.

This was validated by a report by the Department of Transportation which found FAA managers had allowed Southwest Airlines to fly 46 airplanes in 2006 and 2007 that were overdue for safety inspections, ignoring concerns raised by inspectors. Audits of other airlines resulted in two airlines grounding hundreds of planes, causing thousands of flight cancellations. The House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee held hearings in April 2008. Jim Oberstar, former chairman of the committee said its investigation uncovered a pattern of regulatory abuse and widespread regulatory lapses, allowing 117 aircraft to be operated commercially although not in compliance with FAA safety rules. Oberstar said there was a \\\"culture of coziness\\\" between senior FAA officials and the airlines and \\\"a systematic breakdown\\\" in the FAA's culture that resulted in \\\"malfeasance, bordering on corruption.\\\" In 2008 the FAA proposed to fine Southwest $10.2 million for failing to inspect older planes for cracks, and in 2009 Southwest and the FAA agreed that Southwest would pay a $7.5 million penalty and would adopt new safety procedures, with the fine doubling if Southwest failed to follow through.\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"570aa91f4103511400d598ca\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"when\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"2007\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 3\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"570aa91f4103511400d598cb\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"how\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"46\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 394\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"570aa91f4103511400d598cc\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"how\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"$10.2 million\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 1200\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"570aa91f4103511400d598cd\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Jim Oberstar\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 712\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"570aa91f4103511400d598ce\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"how\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"117\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 865\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"The boroughs of Liverpool, Knowsley, St Helens and Sefton were included in Merseyside.

That month, Microsoft held an event for 400 developers in Bellevue, Washington to recruit support for the system. Also that month, Peter Moore, former president of Sega of America, joined Microsoft. On August 12, 2003, ATI signed on to produce the graphic processing unit for the new console, a deal which was publicly announced two days later. Before the launch of the Xbox 360, several Alpha development kits were spotted using Apple's Power Mac G5 hardware. This was because the system's PowerPC 970 processor running the same PowerPC architecture that the Xbox 360 would eventually run under IBM's Xenon processor. The cores of the Xenon processor were developed using a slightly modified version of the PlayStation 3's Cell Processor PPE architecture. According to David Shippy and Mickie Phipps, the IBM employees were \\\"hiding\\\" their work from Sony and Toshiba, IBM's partners in developing the Cell Processor. Jeff Minter created the music visualization program Neon which is included with the Xbox 360.\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"570b1d3d6b8089140040f71e\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"J Allard\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 227\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"570b1d3d6b8089140040f71f\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"ATI\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 456\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"570b1d3d6b8089140040f720\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"where\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Sega of America\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 401\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"570b1d3d6b8089140040f721\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Apple's Power Mac G5\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 667\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"570b1d3d6b8089140040f722\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"IBM's Xenon processor\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 833\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"Beginning in 1689, the colonies became involved in a series of wars between Great Britain and France for control of North America, the most important of which were Queen Anne's War, in which the British conquered French colony Acadia, and the final French and Indian War (1754\\u201363) when Britain was victorious over all the French colonies in North America.

It is a measure of the variety of organisms present in different ecosystems. This can refer to genetic variation, ecosystem variation, or species variation (number of species) within an area, biome, or planet. Terrestrial biodiversity tends to be greater near the equator, which seems to be the result of the warm climate and high primary productivity. Biodiversity is not distributed evenly on Earth. It is richest in the tropics. Marine biodiversity tends to be highest along coasts in the Western Pacific, where sea surface temperature is highest and in the mid-latitudinal band in all oceans. There are latitudinal gradients in species diversity. Biodiversity generally tends to cluster in hotspots, and has been increasing through time, but will be likely to slow in the future.\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"570bc0386b8089140040fa0a\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Biodiversity\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 0\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"570bc0386b8089140040fa0b\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"genetic variation, ecosystem variation, or species variation\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 352\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"570bc0386b8089140040fa0c\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Terrestrial biodiversity\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 467\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"570bc0386b8089140040fa0d\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"where\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"It is richest in the tropics.\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 659\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"570bc0386b8089140040fa0e\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"where\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"along coasts in the Western Pacific\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 729\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"Originally based on the English alphabet, ASCII encodes 128 specified characters into seven-bit integers as shown by the ASCII chart on the right.

After undergoing mastication and starch digestion, the food will be in the form of a small, round slurry mass called a bolus. It will then travel down the esophagus and into the stomach by the action of peristalsis. Gastric juice in the stomach starts protein digestion. Gastric juice mainly contains hydrochloric acid and pepsin. As these two chemicals may damage the stomach wall, mucus is secreted by the stomach, providing a slimy layer that acts as a shield against the damaging effects of the chemicals. At the same time protein digestion is occurring, mechanical mixing occurs by peristalsis, which is waves of muscular contractions that move along the stomach wall. This allows the mass of food to further mix with the digestive enzymes.\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"570be2d2ec8fbc190045bbbe\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"the action of mastication (chewing)\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 100\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"570be2d2ec8fbc190045bbbf\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"a liquid secreted by the salivary glands\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 212\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"570be2d2ec8fbc190045bbc0\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"salivary amylase\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 263\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"570be2d2ec8fbc190045bbc1\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"a small, round slurry mass\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 581\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"570be2d2ec8fbc190045bbc2\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"peristalsis\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 701\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"Hoover began using wiretapping in the 1920s during Prohibition to arrest bootleggers.

After Prohibition's repeal, Congress passed the Communications Act of 1934, which outlawed non-consensual phone tapping, but allowed bugging. In the 1939 case Nardone v. United States, the court ruled that due to the 1934 law, evidence the FBI obtained by phone tapping was inadmissible in court. After the 1967 case Katz v.

Henry II of England and Eleanor of Aquitaine on 24 December 1166. Henry had inherited significant territories along the Atlantic seaboard\\u2014Anjou, Normandy and England\\u2014and expanded his empire by conquering Brittany. Henry married the powerful Eleanor of Aquitaine, who reigned over the Duchy of Aquitaine and had a tenuous claim to Toulouse and Auvergne in southern France, in addition to being the former wife of Louis VII of France. The result was the Angevin Empire, named after Henry's paternal title as Count of Anjou and, more specifically, its seat in Angers.[nb 2] The Empire, however, was inherently fragile: although all the lands owed allegiance to Henry, the disparate parts each had their own histories, traditions and governance structures. As one moved south through Anjou and Aquitaine, the extent of Henry's power in the provinces diminished considerably, scarcely resembling the modern concept of an empire at all. Some of the traditional ties between parts of the empire such as Normandy and England were slowly dissolving over time. It was unclear what would happen to the empire on Henry's death. Although the custom of primogeniture, under which an eldest son would inherit all his father's lands, was slowly becoming more widespread across Europe, it was less popular amongst the Norman kings of England. Most believed that Henry would divide the empire, giving each son a substantial portion, and hoping that his children would continue to work together as allies after his death. To complicate matters, much of the Angevin empire was held by Henry only as a vassal of the King of France of the rival line of the House of Capet. Henry had often allied himself with the Holy Roman Emperor against France, making the feudal relationship even more challenging.\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"570c4c8ab3d812140066d093\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"when\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"24 December 1166\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 65\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"570c4c8ab3d812140066d094\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"who\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Eleanor of Aquitaine\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 258\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"570c4c8ab3d812140066d095\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"who\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Holy Roman Emperor\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 1708\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"The Macintosh, however, was expensive, which hindered its ability to be competitive in a market already dominated by the Commodore 64 for consumers, as well as the IBM Personal Computer and its accompanying clone market for businesses.

In the 1990s, improvements in the rival Wintel platform, notably with the introduction of Windows 3.0, then Windows 95, gradually took market share from the more expensive Macintosh systems. The performance advantage of 68000-based Macintosh systems was eroded by Intel's Pentium, and in 1994 Apple was relegated to third place as Compaq became the top PC manufacturer. Even after a transition to the superior PowerPC-based Power Macintosh (later renamed the PowerMac, in line with the PowerBook series) line in 1994, the falling prices of commodity PC components and the release of Windows 95 saw the Macintosh user base decline.\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"570cd0bbb3d812140066d27f\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"expensive\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 28\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"570cd0bbb3d812140066d280\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"where\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"education and desktop publishing\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 277\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"570cd0bbb3d812140066d281\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"when\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Wintel\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 424\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"570cd0bbb3d812140066d282\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"performance\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 579\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"570cd0bbb3d812140066d283\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"who\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Compaq\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 715\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"Anti-aircraft warfare or counter-air defence is defined by NATO as \\\"all measures designed to nullify or reduce the effectiveness of hostile air action.\\\" They include ground-and air-based weapon systems, associated sensor systems, command and control arrangements and passive measures (e.g. barrage balloons).

A number of European soldiers came on their own to help, such as Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben, who taught the army Prussian tactics and organizational skills.\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"570d2681fed7b91900d45c63\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"when\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"14 June 1775\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 36\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"570d2681fed7b91900d45c64\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"who\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"George Washington\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 141\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"570d2681fed7b91900d45c65\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Europe\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 457\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"570d2681fed7b91900d45c66\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Prussian tactics and organizational skills\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 561\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"The German states proclaimed their union as the German Empire under the Prussian king, Wilhelm I, uniting Germany as a nation-state.

A variety of 19th-century movements, including liberalism and neo-classicism, trace their intellectual heritage back to the Enlightenment.\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"570ec9a70b85d914000d7f9f\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"1715\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 64\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"570ec9a70b85d914000d7fa0\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"scientific revolution\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 226\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"570ec9a70b85d914000d7fa1\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"the Enlightenment.\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 760\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"570ec9a70b85d914000d7fa2\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"The Philosophes\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 249\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57103d79b654c5140001f8bb\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"1715\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 64\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57103d79b654c5140001f8bc\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"1789\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 104\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57103d79b654c5140001f8bd\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"1620s\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 197\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"Circadian rhythms allow organisms to anticipate and prepare for precise and regular environmental changes.

Direct review of a capital sentencing hearing will result in one of three outcomes. If the appellate court finds that no significant legal errors occurred in the capital sentencing hearing, the appellate court will affirm the judgment, or let the sentence stand. If the appellate court finds that significant legal errors did occur, then it will reverse the judgment, or nullify the sentence and order a new capital sentencing hearing. Lastly, if the appellate court finds that no reasonable juror could find the defendant eligible for the death penalty, a rarity, then it will order the defendant acquitted, or not guilty, of the crime for which he/she was given the death penalty, and order him sentenced to the next most severe punishment for which the offense is eligible.

Other estimates place Ashkenazi Jews as making up about 75% of Jews worldwide.\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57194aad3e985219001bc016\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"74%\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 542\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57194aad3e985219001bc017\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"11th century\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 28\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57194aad3e985219001bc018\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"which\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Holocaust\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 222\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57194aad3e985219001bc019\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"1931\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 141\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"571a5a3d10f8ca1400304feb\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"92 percent\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 165\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"571a5a3d10f8ca1400304fef\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"how\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"16.7 million\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 288\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"571a5a3d10f8ca1400304fec\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"three percent of the world's Jewish population, while at their peak in 1931 they accounted for 92 percent\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 70\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"571a5a3d10f8ca1400304fed\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"who\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Sergio DellaPergola\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 427\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"571a5a3d10f8ca1400304fee\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"which\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"10 million and 11.2 million\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 398\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"Saint Athanasius of Alexandria (/\\u02cc\\u00e6\\u03b8\\u0259\\u02c8ne\\u026a\\u0283\\u0259s/; Greek: \\u1f08\\u03b8\\u03b1\\u03bd\\u03ac\\u03c3\\u03b9\\u03bf\\u03c2 \\u1f08\\u03bb\\u03b5\\u03be\\u03b1\\u03bd\\u03b4\\u03c1\\u03b5\\u03af\\u03b1\\u03c2, Athan\\u00e1sios Alexandr\\u00edas; c. 296\\u2013298 \\u2013 2 May 373), also called Athanasius the Great, Athanasius the Confessor or, primarily in the Coptic Orthodox Church, Athanasius the Apostolic, was the twentieth bishop of Alexandria (as Athanasius I).

The blood pressure raising and vasoconstrictive effects of adrenal extracts were of particular interest to surgeons as hemostatic agents and as treatment for shock, and a number of companies developed products based on adrenal extracts containing varying purities of the active substance. In 1897 John Abel of Johns Hopkins University identified the active principle as epinephrine, which he isolated in an impure state as the sulfate salt. Industrial chemist Jokichi Takamine later developed a method for obtaining epinephrine in a pure state, and licensed the technology to Parke Davis. Parke Davis marketed epinephrine under the trade name Adrenalin. Injected epinephrine proved to be especially efficacious for the acute treatment of asthma attacks, and an inhaled version was sold in the United States until 2011 (Primatene Mist). By 1929 epinephrine had been formulated into an inhaler for use in the treatment of nasal congestion.\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"571a6dbe4faf5e1900b8a9a0\",\n

This UN plan specified borders for new Arab and Jewish states and also specified an area of Jerusalem and its environs which was to be administered by the UN under an international regime. The end of the British Mandate for Palestine was set for midnight on 14 May 1948. That day, David Ben-Gurion, the executive head of the Zionist Organization and president of the Jewish Agency for Palestine, declared \\\"the establishment of a Jewish state in Eretz Israel, to be known as the State of Israel,\\\" which would start to function from the termination of the mandate. The borders of the new state were not specified in the declaration. Neighboring Arab armies invaded the former Palestinian mandate on the next day and fought the Israeli forces. Israel has since fought several wars with neighboring Arab states, in the course of which it has occupied the West Bank, Sinai Peninsula (1956\\u201357, 1967\\u201382), part of Southern Lebanon (1982\\u20132000), Gaza Strip (1967\\u20132005; still considered occupied after 2005 disengagement) and the Golan Heights. It extended its laws to the Golan Heights and East Jerusalem, but not the West Bank. Efforts to resolve the Israeli\\u2013Palestinian conflict have not resulted in peace. However, peace treaties between Israel and both Egypt and Jordan have successfully been signed. Israel's occupation of Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem is the world's longest military occupation in modern times.[note 2]\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5725b267b80e561500fa6f28\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"when\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"29 November 1947\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 3\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5725b267b80e561500fa6f29\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"when\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"midnight on 14 May 1948\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 394\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5725b267b80e561500fa6f2a\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"who\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"David Ben-Gurion\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 429\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"The Hellenistic period covers the period of ancient Greek (Hellenic) history and Mediterranean history between the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC and the emergence of the Roman Empire as signified by the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the subsequent conquest of Ptolemaic Egypt the following year. At this time, Greek cultural influence and power was at its peak in Europe, Africa and Asia, experiencing prosperity and progress in the arts, exploration, literature, theatre, architecture, music, mathematics, philosophy, and science. For example, competitive public games took place, ideas in biology, and popular entertainment in theaters. It is often considered a period of transition, sometimes even of decadence or degeneration, compared to the enlightenment of the Greek Classical era. The Hellenistic period saw the rise of New Comedy, Alexandrian poetry, the Septuagint and the philosophies of Stoicism and Epicureanism. Greek Science was advanced by the works of the mathematician Euclid and the polymath Archimedes. The religious sphere expanded to include new gods such as the Greco-Egyptian Serapis, eastern deities such as Attis and Cybele and the Greek adoption of Buddhism.\",\n        \"qas\": [\n

Buonaparte; 15 August 1769 \\u2013 5 May 1821) was a French military and political leader who rose to prominence during the French Revolution and led several successful campaigns during the Revolutionary Wars. As Napoleon I, he was Emperor of the French from 1804 until 1814, and again in 1815. Napoleon dominated European and global affairs for more than a decade while leading France against a series of coalitions in the Napoleonic Wars. He won most of these wars and the vast majority of his battles, building a large empire that ruled over continental Europe before its final collapse in 1815. Often considered one of the greatest commanders in history, his wars and campaigns are studied at military schools worldwide. He also remains one of the most celebrated and controversial political figures in Western history. In civil affairs, Napoleon had a major long-term impact by bringing liberal reforms to the territories that he conquered, especially the Low Countries, Switzerland, and large parts of modern Italy and Germany. He implemented fundamental liberal policies in France and throughout Western Europe.[note 1] His lasting legal achievement, the Napoleonic Code, has been adopted in various forms by a quarter of the world's legal systems, from Japan to Quebec.\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5725b31769ff041400e58e32\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"the French\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 329\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5725b31769ff041400e58e33\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"when\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"1815\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 679\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5725b31769ff041400e58e34\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"where\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"military schools\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 783\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5725b31769ff041400e58e35\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"liberal reforms\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 978\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5725b31769ff041400e58e36\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"the Napoleonic Code\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 1244\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57263f11ec44d21400f3dcb9\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"when\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"15 August 1769\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 104\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57263f11ec44d21400f3dcba\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"when\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"5 May 1821\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 121\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57263f11ec44d21400f3dcbb\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"French\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 139\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57263f11ec44d21400f3dcbc\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"the French Revolution\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 206\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57263f11ec44d21400f3dcbd\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"when\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"1815\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 679\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"572649185951b619008f6f0e\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"when\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"5 May 1821\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 121\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"572649185951b619008f6f10\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"the French Revolution\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 206\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (or the Gates Foundation, abbreviated as BMGF) is the largest private foundation in the world, founded by Bill and Melinda Gates.

The word \\\"poultry\\\" comes from the French/Norman word poule, itself derived from the Latin word pullus, which means small animal.\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5725b87189a1e219009abd66\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"kept by humans for the eggs they produce, their meat, their feathers, or sometimes as pets.\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 45\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5725b87189a1e219009abd67\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"Are all domesticated and wild birds classified as poultry  ?\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"but does not include similar wild birds hunted for sport or food and known as game.\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 534\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5725b87189a1e219009abd68\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"chickens, quails and turkeys\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 264\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5725b87189a1e219009abd69\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"Was the Latin word for poultry also used to decribe other small animals as opposed to any poulty?\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"from the Latin word pullus, which means small animal.\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 693\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5725b87189a1e219009abd6a\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"Are any other birds considered common in the world of poultry?\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"domestic ducks and domestic geese.\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 386\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"Arsenal was the first club from the south of England to join The Football League, in 1893.

Ultimately sensitivity is limited by the quantum efficiency of the film or sensor.\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57263b5b38643c19005ad33b\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"sensitivity\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 560\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57263b5b38643c19005ad33c\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"slow film\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 193\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57263b5b38643c19005ad33d\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"reduction of exposure\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 308\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57263b5b38643c19005ad33e\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Highly sensitive films\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 204\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57263b5b38643c19005ad33f\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"reduced image quality\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 394\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"Mexico City, or the City of Mexico (Spanish: Ciudad de M\\u00e9xico  audio (help\\u00b7info) American Spanish: [sju\\u02c8\\u00f0a(\\u00f0) \\u00f0e \\u02c8m\\u00e9xiko]; abbreviated as \\\"CDMX\\\"), is the capital of Mexico.

Often it is in the center or left side of the chest and lasts for more than a few minutes. The discomfort may occasionally feel like heartburn. Other symptoms may include shortness of breath, nausea, feeling faint, a cold sweat, or feeling tired. About 30% of people have atypical symptoms, with women more likely than men to present atypically. Among those over 75 years old, about 5% have had an MI with little or no history of symptoms.

Mercury joined the band in 1970, suggested \\\"Queen\\\" as a new band name, and adopted his familiar stage name. John Deacon was recruited prior to recording their eponymous debut album in 1973. Queen first charted in the UK with their second album, Queen II, in 1974, but it was the release of Sheer Heart Attack later that year and A Night at the Opera in 1975 which brought them international success. The latter featured \\\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\\", which stayed at number one in the UK for nine weeks and popularised the music video. Their 1977 album, News of the World, contained \\\"We Will Rock You\\\" and \\\"We Are the Champions\\\", which have become anthems at sporting events. By the early 1980s, Queen were one of the biggest stadium rock bands in the world. Their performance at 1985's Live Aid is ranked among the greatest in rock history by various music publications, with a 2005 industry poll ranking it the best. In 1991, Mercury died of bronchopneumonia, a complication of AIDS, and Deacon retired in 1997. Since then, May and Taylor have occasionally performed together, including with Paul Rodgers (2004\\u201309) and with Adam Lambert (since 2011). In November 2014, Queen released a new album, Queen Forever, featuring vocals from the late Mercury.\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57265492f1498d1400e8dc32\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Smile\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 85\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57265492f1498d1400e8dc33\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Freddie Mercury\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 92\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57265492f1498d1400e8dc34\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Queen Forever\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 1462\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57265492f1498d1400e8dc35\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"News of the World\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 817\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57265492f1498d1400e8dc36\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"1991\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 1185\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"Presbyterianism is a part of the Reformed tradition within Protestantism which traces its origins to the British Isles.

Many Reformed churches are organized this way, but the word \\\"Presbyterian,\\\" when capitalized, is often applied uniquely to the churches that trace their roots to the Scottish and English churches that bore that name and English political groups that formed during the English Civil War. Presbyterian theology typically emphasizes the sovereignty of God, the authority of the Scriptures, and the necessity of grace through faith in Christ. Presbyterian church government was ensured in Scotland by the Acts of Union in 1707 which created the kingdom of Great Britain. In fact, most Presbyterians found in England can trace a Scottish connection, and the Presbyterian denomination was also taken to North America mostly by Scots and Scots-Irish immigrants. The Presbyterian denominations in Scotland hold to the theology of John Calvin and his immediate successors, although there are a range of theological views within contemporary Presbyterianism. Local congregations of churches which use presbyterian polity are governed by sessions made up of representatives of the congregation (elders); a conciliar approach which is found at other levels of decision-making (presbytery, synod and general assembly).\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"572655b6f1498d1400e8dc58\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"where\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"British Isles\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 105\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"572655b6f1498d1400e8dc59\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"sovereignty of God\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 601\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"572655b6f1498d1400e8dc5a\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"which\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Great Britain\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 819\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"Since the Protestant Reformation, the most prominent Christian denomination in Thuringia has been Lutheranism.

Members of the Catholic Church formed 7.8% of the population, while 68.2% of Thuringians were non-religious or adhere to other faiths.

Catholic regions are the Eichsfeld in the northwest and parts of the Rh\\u00f6n Mountains around Geisa in the southwest. Protestant church membership is shrinking rapidly, whereas the Catholic Church is somewhat more stable because of Catholic migration from Poland, Southern Europe and West Germany. Other religions play no significant role in Thuringia. There are only a few thousand Muslims (largely migrants) and about 750 Jews (mostly migrants from Russia) living in Thuringia. Furthermore, there are some Orthodox communities of Eastern European migrants and some traditional Protestant Free churches in Thuringia without any societal influence.\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57265912dd62a815002e8252\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Lutheranism\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 98\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57265912dd62a815002e8253\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"how\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Today over two thirds of the population\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 229\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57265912dd62a815002e8254\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"which\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"The Protestant Evangelical Church in Germany\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 287\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57265912dd62a815002e8255\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"how\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"7.8% of the population\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 469\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57265912dd62a815002e8256\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"how\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"750 Jews\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 1157\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"In an ecosystem, predation is a biological interaction where a predator (an organism that is hunting) feeds on its prey (the organism that is attacked). Predators may or may not kill their prey prior to feeding on them, but the act of predation often results in the death of the prey and the eventual absorption of the prey's tissue through consumption. Thus predation is often, though not always, carnivory. Other categories of consumption are herbivory (eating parts of plants), fungivory (eating parts of fungi), and detritivory (the consumption of dead organic material (detritus)). All these consumption categories fall under the rubric of consumer-resource systems. It can often be difficult to separate various types of feeding behaviors. For example, some parasitic species prey on a host organism and then lay their eggs on it for their offspring to feed on it while it continues to live in or on its decaying corpse after it has died. The key characteristic of predation however is the predator's direct impact on the prey population. On the other hand, detritivores simply eat dead organic material arising from the decay of dead individuals and have no direct impact on the \\\"donor\\\" organism(s).\",\n        \"qas\": [\n

As a result, its political, legal, linguistic and cultural legacy is widespread.

The term pesticide includes all of the following: herbicide, insecticide, insect growth regulator, nematicide, termiticide, molluscicide, piscicide, avicide, rodenticide, predacide, bactericide, insect repellent, animal repellent, antimicrobial, fungicide, disinfectant (antimicrobial), and sanitizer.\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57268054dd62a815002e8764\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"pesticides are also used for non-agricultural purposes\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 480\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57268054dd62a815002e8765\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Pesticides are substances meant for attracting, seducing, and then destroying any pest\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 0\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57268054dd62a815002e8766\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"The most common use of pesticides is as plant protection products\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 117\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57268054dd62a815002e8767\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"protect plants from damaging influences such as weeds, fungi, or insects\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 242\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57268054dd62a815002e8768\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"sanitizer\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 827\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"Somerset is a rural county of rolling hills such as the Blackdown Hills, Mendip Hills, Quantock Hills and Exmoor National Park, and large flat expanses of land including the Somerset Levels.

The major philosophies during the period, Confucianism, Legalism, Mohism, Agrarianism and Taoism, each had a political aspect to their philosophical schools. Philosophers such as Confucius, Mencius, and Mozi, focused on political unity and political stability as the basis of their political philosophies. Confucianism advocated a hierarchical, meritocratic government based on empathy, loyalty, and interpersonal relationships. Legalism advocated a highly authoritarian government based on draconian punishments and laws. Mohism advocated a communal, decentralized government centered on frugality and ascetism. The Agrarians advocated a peasant utopian communalism and egalitarianism. Taoism advocated a proto-anarchism. Legalism was the dominant political philosophy of the Qin Dynasty, but was replaced by State Confucianism in the Han Dynasty. Prior to China's adoption of communism, State Confucianism remained the dominant political philosophy of China up to the 20th century.\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"572696dff1498d1400e8e48e\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Chinese political philosophy\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 0\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"572696dff1498d1400e8e48f\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"6th century BC\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 108\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"572696dff1498d1400e8e490\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"the social and political breakdown of the country\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 184\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"572696dff1498d1400e8e491\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Mohism\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 835\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"An alloy is a mixture of metals or a mixture of a metal and another element.

Succeeding Pope John XXIII, he continued the Second Vatican Council which he closed in 1965, implementing its numerous reforms, and fostered improved ecumenical relations with Eastern Orthodox and Protestants, which resulted in many historic meetings and agreements. Montini served in the Vatican's Secretariat of State from 1922 to 1954. While in the Secretariat of State, Montini and Domenico Tardini were considered as the closest and most influential colleagues of Pope Pius XII, who in 1954 named him Archbishop of Milan, the largest Italian diocese. Montini automatically became the Secretary of the Italian Bishops Conference. John XXIII elevated him to the College of Cardinals in 1958, and after the death of John XXIII, Montini was considered one of his most likely successors.\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57269bfff1498d1400e8e4c0\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"26 September 1897\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 184\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57269bfff1498d1400e8e4c1\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"6 August 1978)\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 204\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57269bfff1498d1400e8e4c2\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"1965\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 363\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57269bfff1498d1400e8e4c3\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"when\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"21 June 1963\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 241\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57269bfff1498d1400e8e4c4\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Giovanni\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 57\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"During George's reign the break-up of the British Empire and its transition into the Commonwealth of Nations accelerated.

Though Britain and its allies were ultimately victorious in 1945, the United States and the Soviet Union rose as pre-eminent world powers and the British Empire declined. After the independence of India and Pakistan in 1947, George remained as king of both countries, but the title Emperor of India was abandoned in June 1948. Ireland formally declared itself a republic and left the Commonwealth in 1949, and India became a republic within the Commonwealth the following year. George adopted the new title of Head of the Commonwealth. He was beset by health problems in the later years of his reign.

Another advanced Nutrition Professional is a Certified Nutrition Specialist or CNS. These Board Certified Nutritionists typically specialize in obesity and chronic disease.

Paying two visits to the archipelago, Berm\\u00fadez never landed on the islands, but did create a recognisable map of the archipelago.

Subsequent Spanish or other European parties are believed to have released pigs there, which had become feral and abundant on the island by the time European settlement began.

The conductors can be thin films, foils or sintered beads of metal or conductive electrolyte, etc. The nonconducting dielectric acts to increase the capacitor's charge capacity. Materials commonly used as dielectrics include glass, ceramic, plastic film, air, vacuum, paper, mica, and oxide layers.

Historiography of science, in contrast, often draws on the historical methods of both intellectual history and social history.\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5726eab6f1498d1400e8efcc\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"The history of science\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 0\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5726eab6f1498d1400e8efcd\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"the history of scholarship\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 202\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5726eab6f1498d1400e8efce\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"real world\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 410\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5726eab6f1498d1400e8efcf\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Historiography of science\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 432\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"Czech (/\\u02c8t\\u0283\\u025bk/; \\u010de\\u0161tina Czech pronunciation: [\\u02c8t\\u0361\\u0283\\u025b\\u0283c\\u026ana]), formerly known as Bohemian (/bo\\u028a\\u02c8hi\\u02d0mi\\u0259n, b\\u0259-/; lingua Bohemica in Latin), is a West Slavic language strongly influenced by Latin and German language, spoken by over 10 million people and it is the official language of the Czech Republic.

Glaciers slowly deform and flow due to stresses induced by their weight, creating crevasses, seracs, and other distinguishing features. They also abrade rock and debris from their substrate to create landforms such as cirques and moraines.

The ultimate objective of the textual critic's work is the production of a \\\"critical edition\\\" containing a scholarly curated text.\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"572773f6708984140094dded\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"a manuscript copy, several or many copies, but not the original document\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 263\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"572773f6708984140094ddee\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"the production of a \\\"critical edition\\\" containing a scholarly curated text.\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 642\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"572773f6708984140094ddef\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"philology\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 54\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"572773f6708984140094ddf0\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"Why are there differences in ancient copies of the same text?\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Ancient scribes made alterations when copying manuscripts by hand\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 190\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"572773f6708984140094ddf1\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"recensions\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 536\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"A gramophone record (phonograph record in American English) or vinyl record, commonly known as a \\\"record\\\", is an analogue sound storage medium in the form of a flat polyvinyl chloride (previously shellac) disc with an inscribed, modulated spiral groove.

The term is also used, albeit rarely, as a synonym for alla breve.\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"572782eb5951b619008f8bc1\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"in the manner of the chapel\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 39\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"572782eb5951b619008f8bc2\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"alla breve\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 649\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"572782eb5951b619008f8bc3\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"19th century\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 385\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"572782eb5951b619008f8bc4\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"how\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"group or solo singing without instrumental accompaniment\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 91\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"572782eb5951b619008f8bc5\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"which\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Renaissance polyphony and Baroque concertato\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 326\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"The Order of Preachers (Latin: Ordo Praedicatorum, hence the abbreviation OP used by members), more commonly known after the 15th century as the Dominican Order or Dominicans, is a Roman Catholic religious order founded by the Spanish priest Saint Dominic de Guzman in France and approved by Pope Honorius III (1216\\u201327) on 22 December 1216.

The games can be held between separate teams or between parts of the same team.\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5727b9623acd2414000dea9f\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"exhibition game\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 3\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5727b9623acd2414000deaa0\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"exhibition game\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 3\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5727b9623acd2414000deaa1\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"exhibition game\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 3\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5727b9623acd2414000deaa2\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"exhibition game\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 3\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5727b9623acd2414000deaa3\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"exhibition game\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 3\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"Strasbourg (/\\u02c8str\\u00e6zb\\u025c\\u02d0r\\u0261/, French pronunciation: \\u200b[st\\u0281az.bu\\u0281, st\\u0281as.bu\\u0281]; Alsatian: Strossburi; German: Stra\\u00dfburg, [\\u02c8\\u0283t\\u0281a\\u02d0sb\\u028a\\u0250\\u032fk]) is the capital and largest city of the Alsace-Champagne-Ardenne-Lorraine (ACAL) region in eastern France and is the official seat of the European Parliament.

Oklahoma is the 20th most extensive and the 28th most populous of the 50 United States. The state's name is derived from the Choctaw words okla and humma, meaning \\\"red people\\\". It is also known informally by its nickname, The Sooner State, in reference to the non-Native settlers who staked their claims on the choicest pieces of land before the official opening date, and the Indian Appropriations Act of 1889, which opened the door for white settlement in America's Indian Territory. The name was settled upon statehood, Oklahoma Territory and Indian Territory were merged and Indian was dropped from the name. On November 16, 1907, Oklahoma became the 46th state to enter the union. Its residents are known as Oklahomans, or informally \\\"Okies\\\", and its capital and largest city is Oklahoma City.\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5727cbc3ff5b5019007d9564\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Asgaya gigageyi\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 36\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5727cbc3ff5b5019007d9565\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Uukuhu\\u00fawa\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 106\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5727cbc3ff5b5019007d9566\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Gahnawiyo\\u02c0geh\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 125\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5727cbc3ff5b5019007d9567\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"where\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"28th\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 239\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5727cbc3ff5b5019007d9568\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"The Sooner State\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 417\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"The history of India includes the prehistoric settlements and societies in the Indian subcontinent;

Its successor, the PlayStation 4, was released later in November 2013.\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5728027d3acd2414000df20d\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"2006\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 86\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5728027d3acd2414000df20e\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"PlayStation Network\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 314\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5728027d3acd2414000df20f\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Slim\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 493\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5728027d3acd2414000df210\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"2012\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 752\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5728027d3acd2414000df211\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"how\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"85 million\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 845\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"Royal assent is sometimes associated with elaborate ceremonies.

According to Wilson, an early reference to the word \\\"samurai\\\" appears in the Kokin Wakash\\u016b (905\\u2013914), the first imperial anthology of poems, completed in the first part of the 10th century.\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5728ea364b864d1900165084\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"translator\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 94\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5728ea364b864d1900165085\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"bushi (\\u6b66\\u58eb?, [bu.\\u0255i]) or buke (\\u6b66\\u5bb6?)\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 45\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5728ea364b864d1900165086\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"where\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Kokin Wakash\\u016b\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 556\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5728ea364b864d1900165087\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"when\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"905\\u2013914\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 571\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"As the number of possible tests for even simple software components is practically infinite, all software testing uses some strategy to select tests that are feasible for the available time and resources.

Glass will transmit, reflect and refract light; these qualities can be enhanced by cutting and polishing to make optical lenses, prisms, fine glassware, and optical fibers for high speed data transmission by light. Glass can be colored by adding metallic salts, and can also be painted and printed with vitreous enamels. These qualities have led to the extensive use of glass in the manufacture of art objects and in particular, stained glass windows. Although brittle, silicate glass is extremely durable, and many examples of glass fragments exist from early glass-making cultures. Because glass can be formed or molded into any shape, and also because it is a sterile product, it has been traditionally used for vessels: bowls, vases, bottles, jars and drinking glasses. In its most solid forms it has also been used for paperweights, marbles, and beads. When extruded as glass fiber and matted as glass wool in a way to trap air, it becomes a thermal insulating material, and when these glass fibers are embedded into an organic polymer plastic, they are a key structural reinforcement part of the composite material fiberglass. Some objects historically were so commonly made of silicate glass that they are simply called by the name of the material, such as drinking glasses and reading glasses.\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5729114e3f37b31900477ff5\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"metallic salts\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 399\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5729114e3f37b31900477ff6\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"organic polymer plastic\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 1178\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5729114e3f37b31900477ff7\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"transparency\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 64\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5729114e3f37b31900477ff8\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"optical fibers\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 310\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5729114e3f37b31900477ff9\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"thermal insulating material\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 1100\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"Public policy and political leadership helps to \\\"level the playing field\\\" and drive the wider acceptance of renewable energy technologies.

Zinc production includes froth flotation of the ore, roasting, and final extraction using electricity (electrowinning).\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57296e7e6aef051400154e84\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Zn\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 39\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57296e7e6aef051400154e85\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"30\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 60\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57296e7e6aef051400154e86\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"magnesium\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 170\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57296e7e6aef051400154e87\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"+2\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 247\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57296e7e6aef051400154e88\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"how\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"five\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 315\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"572b4999be1ee31400cb8301\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Zn\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 39\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"572b4999be1ee31400cb8302\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"30\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 60\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"572b4999be1ee31400cb8303\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"magnesium\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 170\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"572b4999be1ee31400cb8304\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"sphalerite\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 365\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"572b4999be1ee31400cb8305\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"electricity\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 587\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"Many early 19th-century neoclassical architects were influenced by the drawings and projects of \\u00c9tienne-Louis Boull\\u00e9e and Claude Nicolas Ledoux.

Artists embraced electronic music, black dance styles and the avant-garde, as well as novel recording technology and production techniques. The movement also saw the frequent intersection of music with art and politics, as artists liberally drew on sources such as critical theory, cinema, performance art and modernist literature.

For his contributions to the development of quantum electrodynamics, Feynman, jointly with Julian Schwinger and Sin-Itiro Tomonaga, received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1965. He developed a widely used pictorial representation scheme for the mathematical expressions governing the behavior of subatomic particles, which later became known as Feynman diagrams. During his lifetime, Feynman became one of the best-known scientists in the world. In a 1999 poll of 130 leading physicists worldwide by the British journal Physics World he was ranked as one of the ten greatest physicists of all time.\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"572e7b47c246551400ce4236\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"parton model\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 347\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"572e7b47c246551400ce4237\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"who\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Julian Schwinger and Sin-Itiro Tomonaga\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 452\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"572e7b47c246551400ce4238\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"1965\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 532\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"572e7b47c246551400ce4239\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Feynman diagrams\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 705\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"572e7b47c246551400ce423a\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"ranked as one of the ten greatest physicists of all time\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 901\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"Muammar Muhammad Abu Minyar al-Gaddafi (Arabic: \\u0645\\u0639\\u0645\\u0631 \\u0645\\u062d\\u0645\\u062f \\u0623\\u0628\\u0648 \\u0645\\u0646\\u064a\\u0627\\u0631 \\u0627\\u0644\\u0642\\u0630\\u0627\\u0641\\u064a\\u200e Arabic pronunciation: [mu\\u0295amar al.qa\\u00f0a\\u02d0fi\\u02d0]; /\\u02c8mo\\u028a.\\u0259m\\u0251\\u02d0r \\u0261\\u0259\\u02c8d\\u0251\\u02d0fi/;  audio (help\\u00b7info); c.\\u20091942 \\u2013 20 October 2011), commonly known as Colonel Gaddafi,[b] was a Libyan revolutionary, politician, and political theorist.

Different systems are used for urban and intercity areas; some electric locomotives can switch to different supply voltages to allow flexibility in operation.\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"572e8592dfa6aa1500f8d097\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"maintenance\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 300\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"572e8592dfa6aa1500f8d098\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"how\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"can switch to different supply voltages\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 482\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"572e8592dfa6aa1500f8d09a\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"freight and passenger traffic\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 367\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"572e8592dfa6aa1500f8d099\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"significant capital expenditure\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 188\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"The Spanish language is the second most spoken language in the United States.

International relations theorists have posited that great power status can be characterized into power capabilities, spatial aspects, and status dimensions. Sometimes the status of great powers is formally recognized in conferences such as the Congress of Vienna or an international structure such as the United Nations Security Council (China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States serve as the body's five permanent members). At the same time the status of great powers can be informally recognized in a forum such as the G7 which consists of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America.\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"572ea7e9dfa6aa1500f8d265\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"A great power\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 0\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"572ea7e9dfa6aa1500f8d266\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"military and economic strength\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 172\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"572ea7e9dfa6aa1500f8d268\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"United Nations Security Council\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 671\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"572ea7e9dfa6aa1500f8d267\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"diplomatic and soft power influence\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 215\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"572ea7e9dfa6aa1500f8d269\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"the G7\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 905\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5730d9efb54a4f140068ccac\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"military and economic strength, as well as diplomatic and soft power influence\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 172\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5730d9efb54a4f140068ccad\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 704\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5730d9efb54a4f140068ccae\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 930\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5730d9efb54a4f140068ccaf\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"power capabilities, spatial aspects, and status dimensions\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 463\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"From 1989 through 1996, the total area of the US was listed as 9,372,610 km2 (3,618,780 sq mi) (land + inland water only).

It was during this period that Rome's control expanded from the city's immediate surroundings to hegemony over the entire Mediterranean world. During the first two centuries of its existence, the Roman Republic expanded through a combination of conquest and alliance, from central Italy to the entire Italian peninsula. By the following century, it included North Africa, Spain, and what is now southern France. Two centuries after that, towards the end of the 1st century BC, it included the rest of modern France, Greece, and much of the eastern Mediterranean. By this time, internal tensions led to a series of civil wars, culminating with the assassination of Julius Caesar, which led to the transition from republic to empire. The exact date of transition can be a matter of interpretation. Historians have variously proposed Julius Caesar's crossing of the Rubicon River in 49 BC, Caesar's appointment as dictator for life in 44 BC, and the defeat of Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC. However, most use the same date as did the ancient Romans themselves, the Roman Senate's grant of extraordinary powers to Octavian and his adopting the title Augustus in 27 BC, as the defining event ending the Republic.\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"572fb719b2c2fd14005683a7\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"when\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"509 BC\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 215\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"572fb719b2c2fd14005683a8\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"when\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"27 BC\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 237\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"572fb719b2c2fd14005683a9\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"the overthrow of the Roman Kingdom\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 156\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"572fb719b2c2fd14005683aa\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"when\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"31 BC\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 1297\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"572fb719b2c2fd14005683ab\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Roman Senate's grant of extraordinary powers to Octavian\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 1378\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"It is generally considered that the Pacific War began on 7/8 December 1941, on which date Japan invaded Thailand and attacked the British possessions of Malaya, Singapore, and Hong Kong as well as the United States military bases in Hawaii, Wake Island, Guam and the Philippines.

Professor Juris Zarins believes the Sumerians were settled along the coast of Eastern Arabia, today's Persian Gulf region, before it flooded at the end of the Ice Age.\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5730a6cd2461fd1900a9cf4f\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"substrate language\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 78\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5730a6cd2461fd1900a9cf50\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"who\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"hunter and fisher peoples\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 194\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5730a6cd2461fd1900a9cf51\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"where\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"marshland\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 238\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5730a6cd2461fd1900a9cf52\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Arabian bifacial\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 309\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5730a6cd2461fd1900a9cf53\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"when\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"26th century BC\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 462\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"Tuvalu (i/tu\\u02d0\\u02c8v\\u0251\\u02d0lu\\u02d0/ too-VAH-loo or /\\u02c8tu\\u02d0v\\u0259lu\\u02d0/ TOO-v\\u0259-loo), formerly known as the Ellice Islands, is a Polynesian island nation located in the Pacific Ocean, midway between Hawaii and Australia.

Mosaic art flourished in the Byzantine Empire from the 6th to the 15th centuries; that tradition was adopted by the Norman kingdom in Sicily in the 12th century, by eastern-influenced Venice, and among the Rus in Ukraine. Mosaic fell out of fashion in the Renaissance, though artists like Raphael continued to practise the old technique.

Priests married, raised families, and led politically active lives. Julius Caesar became pontifex maximus before he was elected consul. The augurs read the will of the gods and supervised the marking of boundaries as a reflection of universal order, thus sanctioning Roman expansionism as a matter of divine destiny. The Roman triumph was at its core a religious procession in which the victorious general displayed his piety and his willingness to serve the public good by dedicating a portion of his spoils to the gods, especially Jupiter, who embodied just rule. As a result of the Punic Wars (264\\u2013146 BC), when Rome struggled to establish itself as a dominant power, many new temples were built by magistrates in fulfillment of a vow to a deity for assuring their military success.\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57318c85a5e9cc1400cdc03b\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"elite\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 63\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57318c85a5e9cc1400cdc03e\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"which\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Jupiter\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 822\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57318c85a5e9cc1400cdc03d\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"509\\u201327 BC\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 189\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57318c85a5e9cc1400cdc03c\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"church and state\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 128\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57318c85a5e9cc1400cdc03f\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Punic Wars\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 874\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"YouTube is a global video-sharing website headquartered in San Bruno, California, United States.

In modern times, humanist movements are typically aligned with secularism, and today humanism typically refers to a non-theistic life stance centred on human agency and looking to science rather than revelation from a supernatural source to understand the world.\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57327732b9d445190005eb3f\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"human beings\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 87\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57327732b9d445190005eb40\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"freedom and progress\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 470\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57327732b9d445190005eb42\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"intellectual movements\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 329\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57327732b9d445190005eb41\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"secularism\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 555\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57327732b9d445190005eb43\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"science\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 672\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"Earth was initially molten due to extreme volcanism and frequent collisions with other bodies.

Julius Caesar became pontifex maximus before he was elected consul. The augurs read the will of the gods and supervised the marking of boundaries as a reflection of universal order, thus sanctioning Roman expansionism as a matter of divine destiny. The Roman triumph was at its core a religious procession in which the victorious general displayed his piety and his willingness to serve the public good by dedicating a portion of his spoils to the gods, especially Jupiter, who embodied just rule.

Though Britain and its allies were ultimately victorious in 1945, the United States and the Soviet Union rose as pre-eminent world powers and the British Empire declined. After the independence of India and Pakistan in 1947, George remained as king of both countries, but the title Emperor of India was abandoned in June 1948. Ireland formally declared itself a republic and left the Commonwealth in 1949, and India became a republic within the Commonwealth the following year. George adopted the new title of Head of the Commonwealth. He was beset by health problems in the later years of his reign.

In 2012, a National Communications Act was also approved by Cabinet members, which lays the foundation for the establishment of a National Communications regulator in the broadcasting and telecommunications sectors.\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56e0f1cd231d4119001ac494\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"how\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"two\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 335\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56e0f1cd231d4119001ac495\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"Are communication services in Somalia mainly located in the public or private sector?\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"private\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 212\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56e0f1cd231d4119001ac496\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Print media\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 443\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56e0f1cd231d4119001ac497\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"2013\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 676\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56e0f1cd231d4119001ac498\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"National Communications Act\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 714\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56e10cc5cd28a01900c674cd\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"Are communications services in Somalia mostly concentrated in the public or private sector?\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"private\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 212\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56e1b286cd28a01900c67a7a\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"private\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 212\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56e1b286cd28a01900c67a7b\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"how\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"two\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 335\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56e1b286cd28a01900c67a7c\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Print media\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 443\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56e1b286cd28a01900c67a7d\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"radio stations and online portals\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 511\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56e1b286cd28a01900c67a7e\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"2013\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 676\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"The biggest change in this year's census was in racial classification.

residence to Hanover. The Dukes of Brunswick-Lüneburg were elevated by the Holy Roman Emperor to the rank of Prince-Elector in 1692, and this elevation was confirmed by the Imperial Diet in 1708. Thus the principality was upgraded to the Electorate of Brunswick-Lüneburg, colloquially known as the Electorate of Hanover after Calenberg's capital (see also: House of Hanover). Its electors would later become monarchs of Great Britain (and from 1801, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland). The first of these was George I Louis, who acceded to the British throne in 1714. The last British monarch who ruled in Hanover was William IV. Semi-Salic law, which required succession by the male line if possible, forbade the accession of Queen Victoria in Hanover. As a male-line descendant of George I, Queen Victoria was herself a member of the House of Hanover. Her descendants, however, bore her husband's titular name of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha.

The desert comprises much of the land found within North Africa, excluding the fertile coastal region situated against the Mediterranean Sea, the Atlas Mountains of the Maghreb, and the Nile Valley of Egypt and Sudan. The Sahara stretches from the Red Sea in the east and the Mediterranean in the north, to the Atlantic Ocean in the west, where the landscape gradually transitions to a coastal plain. To the south, it is delimited by the Sahel, a belt of semi-arid tropical savanna around the Niger River valley and Sudan Region of Sub-Saharan Africa. The Sahara can be divided into several regions, including the western Sahara, the central Ahaggar Mountains, the Tibesti Mountains, the Aïr Mountains, the Ténéré desert, and the Libyan Desert.

Mali consists of eight regions and its borders on the north reach deep into the middle of the Sahara Desert, while the country's southern part, where the majority of inhabitants live, features the Niger and Senegal rivers. The country's economy centers on agriculture and fishing. Some of Mali's prominent natural resources include gold, being the third largest producer of gold in the African continent, and salt. About half the population lives below the international poverty line of $1.25 (U.S.) a day. A majority of the population (55%) are non-denominational Muslims.\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5726aaf25951b619008f7973\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Mali is the eighth-largest country in Africa\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 137\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5726aaf25951b619008f7974\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Bamako\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 309\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5726aaf25951b619008f7975\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Niger and Senegal rivers\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 514\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5726aaf25951b619008f7976\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"prominent natural resources include gold\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 613\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"5726aaf25951b619008f7977\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"(55%) are non-denominational Muslims\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 853\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"Time has long been a major subject of study in religion, philosophy, and science, but defining it in a manner applicable to all fields without circularity has consistently eluded scholars.

electrical energy temporarily in an electric field. The forms of practical capacitors vary widely, but all contain at least two electrical conductors (plates) separated by a dielectric (i.e. an insulator that can store energy by becoming polarized). The conductors can be thin films, foils or sintered beads of metal or conductive electrolyte, etc. The nonconducting dielectric acts to increase the capacitor's charge capacity. Materials commonly used as dielectrics include glass, ceramic, plastic film, air, vacuum, paper, mica, and oxide layers. Capacitors are widely used as parts of electrical circuits in many common electrical devices. Unlike a resistor, an ideal capacitor does not dissipate energy.

Mammals range in size from the 30–40 mm (1.2–1.6 in) bumblebee bat to the 33-meter (108 ft) blue whale.\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57261e7c271a42140099d4a1\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"which\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"blue whale\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 536\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57261e7c271a42140099d4a2\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"which\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"bumblebee bat\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 497\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57261e7c271a42140099d4a3\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"which\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"elephants\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 137\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57261e7c271a42140099d4a4\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"how\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"30–40 mm (1.2–1.6 in)\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 475\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"The term \\\"Great Plains\\\", for the region west of about the 96th or 98th meridian and east of the Rocky Mountains, was not generally used before the early 20th century.

Succeeding Pope John XXIII, he continued the Second Vatican Council which he closed in 1965, implementing its numerous reforms, and fostered improved ecumenical relations with Eastern Orthodox and Protestants, which resulted in many historic meetings and agreements. Montini served in the Vatican's Secretariat of State from 1922 to 1954. While in the Secretariat of State, Montini and Domenico Tardini were considered as the closest and most influential colleagues of Pope Pius XII, who in 1954 named him Archbishop of Milan, the largest Italian diocese.

The city whose name means \\\"Southern Capital\\\" has a prominent place in Chinese history and culture, having served as the capitals of various Chinese dynasties, kingdoms and republican governments dating from the 3rd century AD to 1949. Prior to the advent of pinyin romanization, Nanjing's city name was spelled as Nanking or Nankin. Nanjing has a number of other names, and some historical names are now used as names of districts of the city, and among them there is the name Jiangning (江寧), whose former character Jiang (江, River) is the former part of the name Jiangsu and latter character Ning (寧, simplified form 宁, Peace) is the short name of Nanjing. When being the capital of a state, for instance, ROC, Jing (京) is adopted as the abbreviation of Nanjing. Although as a city located in southern part of China becoming Chinese national capital as early as in Jin dynasty, the name Nanjing was designated to the city in Ming dynasty, about a thousand years later. Nanjing is particularly known as Jinling (金陵, literally meaning Gold Mountain) and the old name has been used since the Warring States Period in Zhou Dynasty.\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56e6eb396fe0821900b8ec24\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"k\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"ks\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 232\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56e6eb396fe0821900b8ec25\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"j\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Ch\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 18\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56e6eb396fe0821900b8ec26\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"n\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"n\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 2\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56e6eb396fe0821900b8ec27\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"b\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"b\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 144\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56e6eb396fe0821900b8ec28\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"v\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"v\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 108\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56e780f800c9c71400d771d1\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Nanjing\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 0\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56e780f800c9c71400d771d2\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"lower Yangtze River region\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 92\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56e780f800c9c71400d771d3\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"when\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Ming dynasty\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 1419\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56e780f800c9c71400d771d4\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"when\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Jin dynasty\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 1359\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56e780f800c9c71400d771d5\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"\\\"Southern Capital\\\"\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 31\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"Switzerland (/ˈswɪtsərlənd/), officially the Swiss Confederation (Latin: Confoederatio Helvetica, hence its abbreviation CH), is a country in Europe.

That month, Microsoft held an event for 400 developers in Bellevue, Washington to recruit support for the system. Also that month, Peter Moore, former president of Sega of America, joined Microsoft. On August 12, 2003, ATI signed on to produce the graphic processing unit for the new console, a deal which was publicly announced two days later. Before the launch of the Xbox 360, several Alpha development kits were spotted using Apple's Power Mac G5 hardware. This was because the system's PowerPC 970 processor running the same PowerPC architecture that the Xbox 360 would eventually run under IBM's Xenon processor. The cores of the Xenon processor were developed using a slightly modified version of the PlayStation 3's Cell Processor PPE architecture. According to David Shippy and Mickie Phipps, the IBM employees were \\\"hiding\\\" their work from Sony and Toshiba, IBM's partners in developing the Cell Processor. Jeff Minter created the music visualization program Neon which is included with the Xbox 360.\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"570b1d3d6b8089140040f71e\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"J Allard\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 227\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"570b1d3d6b8089140040f71f\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"ATI\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 456\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"570b1d3d6b8089140040f720\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"where\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Sega of America\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 401\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"570b1d3d6b8089140040f721\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Apple's Power Mac G5\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 667\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"570b1d3d6b8089140040f722\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"IBM's Xenon processor\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 833\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"Copyright infringement is the use of works protected by copyright law without permission, infringing certain exclusive rights granted to the copyright holder, such as the right to reproduce, distribute, display or perform the protected work, or to make derivative works.

In the 19th century the school incorporated graduate and professional instruction, awarding the first Ph.D. in the United States in 1861 and organizing as a university in 1887.\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57268a89dd62a815002e88c4\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"when\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"1701\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 108\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57268a89dd62a815002e88c5\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"when\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"1718\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 286\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57268a89dd62a815002e88c6\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"Why was the school named Yale College?\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"recognition of a gift from Elihu Yale\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 294\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57268a89dd62a815002e88c7\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"when\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"by 1777\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 468\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57268a89dd62a815002e88c8\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"when\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"1861\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 678\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"Originally known as Buckingham House, the building at the core of today's palace was a large townhouse built for the Duke of Buckingham in 1703 on a site that had been in private ownership for at least 150 years.

The ideas of the Enlightenment undermined the authority of the monarchy and the church, and paved the way for the revolutions of the 18th and 19th centuries. A variety of 19th-century movements, including liberalism and neo-classicism, trace their intellectual heritage back to the Enlightenment.\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"570ec9a70b85d914000d7f9f\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"1715\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 64\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"570ec9a70b85d914000d7fa0\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"scientific revolution\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 226\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"570ec9a70b85d914000d7fa1\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"the Enlightenment.\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 760\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"570ec9a70b85d914000d7fa2\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"The Philosophes\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 249\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57103d79b654c5140001f8bb\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"1715\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 64\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57103d79b654c5140001f8bc\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"1789\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 104\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"57103d79b654c5140001f8bd\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"1620s\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 197\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"The Alps (/ælps/; Italian: Alpi [ˈalpi]; French: Alpes [alp]; German: Alpen [ˈʔalpm̩]; Slovene: Alpe [ˈáːlpɛ]) are the highest and most extensive mountain range system that lies entirely in Europe, stretching approximately 1,200 kilometres (750 mi) across eight Alpine countries: Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Slovenia, and Switzerland. The Caucasus Mountains are higher, and the Urals longer, but both lie partly in Asia. The mountains were formed over tens of millions of years as the African and Eurasian tectonic plates collided. Extreme shortening caused by the event resulted in marine sedimentary rocks rising by thrusting and folding into high mountain peaks such as Mont Blanc and the Matterhorn. Mont Blanc spans the French–Italian border, and at 4,810 m (15,781 ft) is the highest mountain in the Alps. The Alpine region area contains about a hundred peaks higher than 4,000 m (13,123 ft), known as the \\\"four-thousanders\\\".\",\n        \"qas\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56f81f0ea6d7ea1400e173d7\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Europe\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 190\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56f81f0ea6d7ea1400e173d8\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"how\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"1,200 kilometres\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 223\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56f81f0ea6d7ea1400e173d9\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"how\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"over tens of millions of years\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 475\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56f81f0ea6d7ea1400e173da\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"Mont Blanc\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 732\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"56f81f0ea6d7ea1400e173db\",\n                \"is_impossible\": false,\n                \"question\": \"what\",\n                \"answers\": [\n                    {\n                        \"text\": \"the \\\"four-thousanders\\\"\",\n                        \"answer_start\": 936\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"context\": \"In Japanese, they are usually referred to as bushi (武士?, [bu.ɕi]) or buke (武家?).
